                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p>I’m Marcus H. Francisco, an Electrical Engineer from Buffalo, NY, currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering at the University at Buffalo. My engineering journey began in my childhood, where I spent countless hours soldering circuits and exploring electronics under the guidance of my grandfather, a technology teacher. These experiences sparked my passion for problem-solving and hands-on innovation, leading me to pursue Electrical Engineering.</p>

                    <h1>Education</h1>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, where I focus on embedded systems, IoT, and control systems. My coursework and research have allowed me to work on projects like distributed IoT networks, such as "BlueLink," a connection protocol I designed for embedded systems. I have also competed in national hackathons, such as Pinnacle 2021 in Dallas, and led a Digital Twin project, which earned the Russell L. Agrusa Award for Innovation and was published by the Association for Computing Machinery.</p>

                    <h1>Interests</h1>
                    <p>Beyond academics, I am deeply involved in the music community. As a professional French Horn player, I perform with the Amherst Symphony Orchestra, the American Legion Band of Post 264, and sing with the UB Choir and Chamber Singers. I am also an assistant music director for the Enchords A Cappella group. My musical background has given me a keen appreciation for precision, discipline, and harmony—values that also translate into my engineering work.</p>

                    <p>My long-term goal is to merge my technical expertise in embedded systems with leadership skills by obtaining an MBA. I aim to work as an engineer before transitioning into academia as a professor. I also aspire to contribute to sustainable electronics through my work with NextFlex, a consortium focused on advancing Flexible Hybrid Electronics. My future research will continue to explore innovative solutions in smart systems and controls.</p>
