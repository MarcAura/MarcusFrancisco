                <h1>EE 541 Reflection: Exploring Deep Learning</h1>
                
                <p class="justified-text">
                    I took EE 541 to dive into a completely new field within Electrical Engineering that piqued my interest. I excel in mathematics and physics and have always been fascinated by the "black-box magic" of deep learning. To me, calculus is clear-cut, motivated by the pursuit of truth through numbers, while physics employs theoretical principles and laws to bring order to an otherwise unpredictable world. However, at the time of taking this class, deep learning seemed entirely different. Electrical Engineering is rooted in mathematics, differential equations, and physics, all governed by well-defined laws. At first glance, artificial intelligence and machine learning appeared far less structured, relying on unknown weights in a neural network.

                    Neural networks operate in a way that more closely resembles the human brain than traditional circuits. One of the most common applications of neural networks is handwriting recognition. Below is an example from my EE 541 project, where I trained a neural network using a dataset of handwritten numbers.
                    
                    I took signal analysis with Professor Ali in the prior semester. After this class, I knew I wanted to take another course with him. I thoroughly enjoyed his teaching style, from his in-depth explanations to his ability to keep students engaged—even offering protein shakes as incentives. He prefers using chalk, which gives him an old-school approach that I appreciate, particularly since the content of this course was anything but old-school. This course was based on recent engineering research, with some journal articles published the same year we studied them. This made me excited to learn about an unfamiliar yet relevant topic from a professor whose teaching style resonated with me.

                <p class="justified-text">
                     Deep learning can seem abstract, and understanding every facet of a neural network may not be feasible. However, one can form an understanding of the principles and methods used to achieve its design. Neural networks have hundreds or even thousands of nodes and weights, adjusted through learning algorithms that we can build and understand. However, determining why each weight changes and its precise effect on the output is complex. A mathematician [Author Name of 3B1B] explains this well in his breakdown of neural network behavior over successive training cycles.
                    
                    For an excellent visualization of neural networks and their growth through training, I highly recommend this video: [LINK TO 3B1B]. 3B1B is an incredible YouTube channel that has inspired me to explore more advanced areas of mathematics and challenge myself in fields such as deep learning.
                    
                    Throughout the course, I struggled with the abstract nature of this field. To tackle this, I had to accept that fully comprehending every aspect of a deep learning module may not be realistic. Despite this, I was able to learn and design effective models. Over time, I gained a deeper understanding of Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. Randomness plays a critical role in deep learning, often complicating things. However, this randomness is beneficial—it drives educational exploration. A deep learning model must sometimes explore uncharted paths, even if the algorithm is uncertain whether the outcome will improve. This allows the model to discover new, potentially superior approaches.
                    
                    This mirrors my experience in taking EE 541. Much like a neural network making weight adjustments based on limited knowledge, I ventured into an unfamiliar field unsure of my success. Yet, by exploring deep learning, I have grown as an engineer. Much like a neural network performing training to explore alternative options, I took a leap by enrolling in EE 541 without knowing whether I would excel. In the end, I believe I am better for it.
                    
                    
                    Initially, I believed that deep learning was completely different from the predictable, theory-based mathematics I was comfortable with. However, having completed the course, I now understand that this is not the case. A neural network and its teaching algorithm are ultimately just a complex system of equations, designed to adjust weights in a way that optimizes outcomes. In many ways, deep learning is an extension of traditional mathematical principles—it’s simply applied in a novel, dynamic way.

                <h1>EE 553 Reflection: Microfabrication Lab Experience</h1>
                
                <p class="justified-text">
                    I entered the class for Microfabrication of Circuits excited to witness the fundamental processes underlying Electrical Engineering. Much of my EE background and undergraduate education is based on transistors, microelectronics, and the core principles of electrical circuit behavior, including properties of current and voltage. From a broad perspective, basic circuits with a DC source, resistors, and reactive components are easy to comprehend. However, delving deeper into Electrical Engineering reveals complexities such as internal resistance and forward biasing. While these phenomena can be analyzed through differential equations and theoretical models, they are difficult to visualize, making direct observation nearly impossible.

                    To witness microfabrication firsthand is to look behind the curtain, replacing conceptual imagination with real-world experiences in the lab. Since learning how a computer worked in elementary school, I had been eager to understand how computer chips, transistors, and memory devices are made. This course provided a pivotal moment where all my undergraduate Electrical Engineering studies converged into an opportunity to observe microfabrication machines in action.
                    
                    
                    In the microfabrication lab, we worked with highly specialized and expensive equipment. We began by learning how to use an ellipsometer, a device that  . From there, we explored Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) and had the opportunity to examine an Electron Beam Microscope. These machines range in costand require extensive care, training, and supervision to operate. In the EBL process, we adhered specific metals to silicon by first applying a thin 2um layer of platinum on the spin-coated silicon surface. This platinum layer served as an intermediary to enhance the adhesion of gold, as gold adheres poorly to silicon but bonds well to platinum.
                    One of the most fascinating properties we observed was the way incident light reflects off gold nanoparticles. In EBL, an electron beam is directed at a filament of gold, platinum, or another metal. The beam vaporizes the metal, and the vaporized material is then deposited onto a surface in precise patterns. Using this method, we achieved deposition resolutions as fine as 2um.
                    
                    Gold nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent optical properties, allowing them to reflect different frequencies of light. This phenomenon was historically used in ancient times in stained glass windows, where molten glass mixed with gold nanoparticles produced vibrant red hues. In our lab, we unintentionally observed this effect due to a unique occurrence in the deposition process. The EBL machine uses clips to hold down the sample, which inadvertently blocked some of the vaporized gold deposition. This obstruction created a gradient of gold thickness across the sample.
                    
                    An interesting observation was that this deposition gradient resulted in thicknesses below the minimum deposition capability of the EBL machine. This created a visible color gradient on the sample, which we attributed to the optical properties of gold nanoparticles. Our final report documented all experiments performed throughout the semester, including:
                    , Ellipsometry to measure oxide layer thickness on silicon, Electron Beam Lithography (EBL), E-Beam microscope usage, Microfabrication-grade microscope analysis, Profilometry with a newly acquired profilometer , Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) etching experiments, measuring etch rate over time 
                    
                    Additionally, my lab partners and I went beyond the standard course requirements to analyze and document the unexpected gold deposition gradient.

                    Spin coating was another technique we utilized in our experiments. The HF etching study examined the rate at which silicon was etched per second in the HF solution, providing valuable data on controlled material removal. Getting suited up for the cleanroom was a unique experience. The "bunny suit"   worn inside the cleanroom is not for personal safety but rather to protect the sensitive materials and equipment from contamination. Given the extreme sensitivity of these machines, all potential contaminants, including dust and skin particles, must be contained within the suit. Each suit comes in a sterilized plastic package, and we were trained to put them on in a way that prevents external contamination. Before entering the cleanroom, we passed through an air shower, which blasted pressurized air to remove any residual dust or contaminants.

                    My experience in the cleanroom was one of the most valuable aspects of my time at UB. This course provided hands-on exposure to the processes required to fabricate the devices and materials that power modern technology. It reinforced my understanding of Electrical Engineering by grounding theoretical concepts in tangible experiences. Rather than relying solely on diagrams and equations, I now have firsthand knowledge of the fabrication techniques that make microelectronics possible.
