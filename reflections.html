                                In this course, the students will learn advanced network design concepts through hands-on experimentation with real-world implementations. The course is divided in two parts. In the first part, the students will follow a guided set of assignments to consolidate the concepts learnt in the related networking courses. The instructor in class will review these concepts and the students will learn how to apply them in a practical environment. Then, a novel embedded system board will be utilized to implement well-known protocols for both wired and wireless networks. In the second part, the students will design, implement and evaluate state-of-the-art and novel networking protocols for real-world application scenarios that each group will come up with. This course will provide the students with the necessary skills to not only theoretically understand but also practically contribute to the development of our internetworked society.

                        <h1>EE 541 Reflection: Exploring Deep Learning</h1>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I took EE 541 to dive into a completely new field within Electrical Engineering that piqued
                            my
                            interest. I excel in mathematics and physics and have always been fascinated by the
                            "black-box
                            magic" of deep learning. To me, calculus is clear-cut, motivated by the pursuit of truth
                            through
                            numbers, while physics employs theoretical principles and laws to bring order to an
                            otherwise
                            unpredictable world. However, at the time of taking this class, deep learning seemed
                            entirely
                            different. Electrical Engineering is rooted in mathematics, differential equations, and
                            physics, all
                            governed by well-defined laws. At first glance, artificial intelligence and machine learning
                            appeared far less structured, relying on unknown weights in a neural network.

                            Neural networks operate in a way that more closely resembles the human brain than
                            traditional
                            circuits. One of the most common applications of neural networks is handwriting recognition.
                            Below
                            is an example from my EE 541 project, where I trained a neural network using a dataset of
                            handwritten numbers.

                            I took signal analysis with Professor Ali in the prior semester. After this class, I knew I
                            wanted
                            to take another course with him. I thoroughly enjoyed his teaching style, from his in-depth
                            explanations to his ability to keep students engaged—even offering protein shakes as
                            incentives. He
                            prefers using chalk, which gives him an old-school approach that I appreciate, particularly
                            since
                            the content of this course was anything but old-school. This course was based on recent
                            engineering
                            research, with some journal articles published the same year we studied them. This made me
                            excited
                            to learn about an unfamiliar yet relevant topic from a professor whose teaching style
                            resonated with
                            me.

                            Deep learning can seem abstract, and understanding every facet of a neural network may not
                            be
                            feasible. However, one can form an understanding of the principles and methods used to
                            achieve its
                            design. Neural networks have hundreds or even thousands of nodes and weights, adjusted
                            through
                            learning algorithms that we can build and understand. However, determining why each weight
                            changes
                            and its precise effect on the output is complex. A mathematician [Author Name of 3B1B]
                            explains this
                            well in his breakdown of neural network behavior over successive training cycles.

                            For an excellent visualization of neural networks and their growth through training, I
                            highly
                            recommend this video: [LINK TO 3B1B]. 3B1B is an incredible YouTube channel that has
                            inspired me to
                            explore more advanced areas of mathematics and challenge myself in fields such as deep
                            learning.

                            Throughout the course, I struggled with the abstract nature of this field. To tackle this, I
                            had to
                            accept that fully comprehending every aspect of a deep learning module may not be realistic.
                            Despite
                            this, I was able to learn and design effective models. Over time, I gained a deeper
                            understanding of
                            Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. Randomness plays a critical role in deep
                            learning, often
                            complicating things. However, this randomness is beneficial—it drives educational
                            exploration. A
                            deep learning model must sometimes explore uncharted paths, even if the algorithm is
                            uncertain
                            whether the outcome will improve. This allows the model to discover new, potentially
                            superior
                            approaches.

                            This mirrors my experience in taking EE 541. Much like a neural network making weight
                            adjustments
                            based on limited knowledge, I ventured into an unfamiliar field unsure of my success. Yet,
                            by
                            exploring deep learning, I have grown as an engineer. Much like a neural network performing
                            training
                            to explore alternative options, I took a leap by enrolling in EE 541 without knowing whether
                            I would
                            excel. In the end, I believe I am better for it.


                            Initially, I believed that deep learning was completely different from the predictable,
                            theory-based
                            mathematics I was comfortable with. However, having completed the course, I now understand
                            that this
                            is not the case. A neural network and its teaching algorithm are ultimately just a complex
                            system of
                            equations, designed to adjust weights in a way that optimizes outcomes. In many ways, deep
                            learning
                            is an extension of traditional mathematical principles—it’s simply applied in a novel,
                            dynamic way.

                            but deep learning introduced an entirely new paradigm where learning-based approaches drive

                        <h1>EE 553 Reflection: Microfabrication Lab Experience</h1>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I entered the class for Microfabrication of Circuits excited to witness the fundamental processes
                            underlying Electrical Engineering. Much of my EE background and undergraduate education is based on
                            transistors, microelectronics, and the core principles of electrical circuit behavior, including
                            properties of current and voltage. From a broad perspective, basic circuits with a DC source,
                            resistors, and reactive components are easy to comprehend. However, delving deeper into Electrical
                            Engineering reveals complexities such as internal resistance and forward biasing. While these
                            phenomena can be analyzed through differential equations and theoretical models, they are difficult
                            to visualize, making direct observation nearly impossible.
        
                            To witness microfabrication firsthand is to look behind the curtain, replacing conceptual
                            imagination with real-world experiences in the lab. Since learning how a computer worked in
                            elementary school, I had been eager to understand how computer chips, transistors, and memory
                            devices are made. This course provided a pivotal moment where all my undergraduate Electrical
                            Engineering studies converged into an opportunity to observe microfabrication machines in action.
        
        
                            In the microfabrication lab, we worked with highly specialized and expensive equipment. We began by
                            learning how to use an ellipsometer, a device that . From there, we explored Electron Beam
                            Lithography (EBL) and had the opportunity to examine an Electron Beam Microscope. These machines
                            range in costand require extensive care, training, and supervision to operate. In the EBL process,
                            we adhered specific metals to silicon by first applying a thin 2um layer of platinum on the
                            spin-coated silicon surface. This platinum layer served as an intermediary to enhance the adhesion
                            of gold, as gold adheres poorly to silicon but bonds well to platinum.
                            One of the most fascinating properties we observed was the way incident light reflects off gold
                            nanoparticles. In EBL, an electron beam is directed at a filament of gold, platinum, or another
                            metal. The beam vaporizes the metal, and the vaporized material is then deposited onto a surface in
                            precise patterns. Using this method, we achieved deposition resolutions as fine as 2um.
        
                            Gold nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent optical properties, allowing them to reflect different
                            frequencies of light. This phenomenon was historically used in ancient times in stained glass
                            windows, where molten glass mixed with gold nanoparticles produced vibrant red hues. In our lab, we
                            unintentionally observed this effect due to a unique occurrence in the deposition process. The EBL
                            machine uses clips to hold down the sample, which inadvertently blocked some of the vaporized gold
                            deposition. This obstruction created a gradient of gold thickness across the sample.
        
                            An interesting observation was that this deposition gradient resulted in thicknesses below the
                            minimum deposition capability of the EBL machine. This created a visible color gradient on the
                            sample, which we attributed to the optical properties of gold nanoparticles. Our final report
                            documented all experiments performed throughout the semester, including:
                            , Ellipsometry to measure oxide layer thickness on silicon, Electron Beam Lithography (EBL), E-Beam
                            microscope usage, Microfabrication-grade microscope analysis, Profilometry with a newly acquired
                            profilometer , Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) etching experiments, measuring etch rate over time
        
                            Additionally, my lab partners and I went beyond the standard course requirements to analyze and
                            document the unexpected gold deposition gradient.

                            Spin coating was another technique we utilized in our experiments. The HF etching study examined the
                            rate at which silicon was etched per second in the HF solution, providing valuable data on
                            controlled material removal. Getting suited up for the cleanroom was a unique experience. The "bunny
                            suit" worn inside the cleanroom is not for personal safety but rather to protect the sensitive
                            materials and equipment from contamination. Given the extreme sensitivity of these machines, all
                            potential contaminants, including dust and skin particles, must be contained within the suit. Each
                            suit comes in a sterilized plastic package, and we were trained to put them on in a way that
                            prevents external contamination. Before entering the cleanroom, we passed through an air shower,
                            which blasted pressurized air to remove any residual dust or contaminants.
        
                            My experience in the cleanroom was one of the most valuable aspects of my time at UB. This course
                            provided hands-on exposure to the processes required to fabricate the devices and materials that
                            power modern technology. It reinforced my understanding of Electrical Engineering by grounding
                            theoretical concepts in tangible experiences. Rather than relying solely on diagrams and equations,
                            I now have firsthand knowledge of the fabrication techniques that make microelectronics possible.

                            When deciding to take Wearable and Implantable Sensors, I considered the multiple projects I’ve
                            contributed to in the past. Multiple hackathon projects, independent works, and an award-winning
                            research project.
        
                            I have worked on various projects in IoT, embedded systems, wireless communication, and power
                            electronics. I worked on 5G KPI analysis which examined the impact of weather on 5G performance
                            using a Raspberry Pi with a 5G hat, and a UPS system providing a cost-effective backup power
                            solution with deep-cycle batteries as part of my coursework. I also co-authored a published research
                            project on Interactive Digital Twins, presented at ACM SenSys ‘22. I became team lead of this
                            research project in 2023, worked on device firmware and intercommunication, and we were awarded the
                            Russel Agrusa Student Innovation Award. Additionally, I contributed to multiple award-winning
                            hackathon projects, such as a fire prevention system, modular security system, and a plastic bottle
                            recycling machine for 3D printer filament. My work has refined my system design ability, knowledge
                            on automation, and real-time data processing.
        
                            All of these projects involved some degree of sensor usage. Combine this affinity for projects using
                            sensors with my love for Dr. Oh’s teaching style, and I knew at once I was dead-set on taking this
                            class.
                            I learned in this class many specialized topics such as microfluidics, accelerometers, inertial
                            sensors, and recent developments in sensor technology.
                            EE526 provided background in the design, implementation, and optimization of wearable and
                            implantable sensor systems. The course covered covering microfluidics, wireless communication, power
                            management, biocompatibility, and data processing for biomedical and IoT applications.
        
                            What I believe was most important is refining my ability to put thought and effort into planning a
                            project on a strict timeline. The projects Dr. Oh assigned were broad enough in subject matter that
                            you could select something you were genuinely interested in. For my project, I chose to make a WiFi
                            and Bluetooth IoT network with an Android app from scratch. In completing this project, I achieved
                            two main milestones that were not exactly course requirements, but were necessary for the completion
                            of my project. For my combination WiFi and BLE project, I developed my own device connection and
                            intercommunication protocol, and I developed an android app having no prior knowledge on how to do
                            so. These skills are not directly related to wearable and implantable sensors, however they both
                            were required to complete the project. For this, I needed to take initiative and learn the skills
                            needed to complete each milestone.
        
                            To be clear, the class doesn’t cover app development, device wireless intercommunication, firmware
                            development, or some of the other tools needed to create my project I dubbed "BlueLink", but
                            Professor Oh urged that students figure out how to acquire the necessary skills to complete project
                            on their own time. I believe this was a great environment, because it forced you to be more
                            realistic about your project expectations, while also getting you invested in project completion.
                            This setup was very helpful to me since it motivated me to start early since there were many
                            uncertain factors in my project. What I recommend for others taking this course is to aim big on the
                            final project and begin scoping out the skills and technologies needed to complete it very early.
                            Dr. Oh gives you the project prompt on the first day of class with the syllabus so you can start as
                            early as the first day.
                            For me, this meant exploring how to build an Android app, and also re-kindling the embers of device
                            intercommunication I acquired working on my research project in past years.
                            Beforehand, working for the ISE department, I was able to establish wired serial communication
                            between two devices with different microcontrollers and hardware. This project presented a different
                            challenge. I now need to establish bi-directional intercommunication between two of the same type of
                            device, (ESP32s), but now the devices operate with different connection protocols. My work
                            beforehand was two different types of hardware communicating, but in this project two different
                            types of firmware must communication. One ESP must communicate via WiFi with the internet and the
                            other must communicate via Bluetooth with the WiFi device.
        
                            The biggest challenge I encountered was programming one of these small, inexpensive devices to use
                            both BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and WiFi at the same time. This large challenge concerned the amount
                            of Flash Memory the devices have available. Flash memory on an ESP32 is used to store the program
                            code, libraries, and necessary data for execution, allowing the microcontroller to retain firmware
                            even after a power cycle. When a program exceeds the available flash memory, the device may fail to
                            compile, crash, or enter a reboot loop due to insufficient storage. To accommodate for this, you can
                            optimize memory usage by reducing the program size (removing unused libraries, optimizing code, or
                            using PROGMEM for constants), increasing partition sizes in the ESP32’s partition table, or using
                            external flash storage for non-critical data.
        
                            The device didn’t have enough flash memory to hold the program and execute it properly. The infinite
                            reboot loop is what my ESP32 devices did whenever I attempted to use both communication types as the
                            same time. This gave me a small hint that the ESP had enough memory to store the program but not
                            enough to run it. To fix this, I altered the partition scheme and eventually found a configuration
                            that would support my connection protocol.
                            Other challenges were power usage and optimizing data processing to draw less power and use less
                            memory. The two competing connection protocols caused the chip to draw too much power, causing a
                            "brownout" or low voltage shutdown, and the two types of communication deliver messages in different
                            formats. Command conversion was needed on the chip, and optimizing this was crucial since I had a
                            limited amount of power and space. At one point I realized I was running too many ESP32 devices on
                            one power supply, resulting in a brownout error. This was a separate problem from the brownout
                            shutdown I mentioned earlier. This problem was amongst the easiest to solve since it only required I
                            get another USB power supply, however that didn't prevent the hours of troubleshooting through
                            software before I discovered the real cause of the problem.
                            My approach to problem solving here needed to be consistent and robust if I were to finish this
                            project on time. By this I mean I needed to implement changes iteratively, so most of the time I am
                            able to deduce the source of an error quickly and begin troubleshooting immediately. If I
                            implemented a hundred changes at once, finding issues would be more similar to finding a needle in a
                            haystack. I tackled each problem one at a time, testing multiple devices each time to make sure the
                            problems were not just a faulty chip. Problems arising from manufacturing defects in the chips
                            happened twice in this project. I reallocated flash memory to program storage by changing the
                            partition scheme, implemented power-saving connection methods, and wrote my own command system
                            specifically for this setup.
                            What I am left with is an IoT network with multiple devices. It uses my own connection protocol that
                            I wrote, and since it uses both BLE and WiFi, local operations do not depend on WiFi, so if a user's
                            WiFi goes down, device intercommunication persists. An example of where this would be useful is if
                            you set up routines for a light or device to turn on and off at a certain time, WiFi dependence may
                            become a cumbersome for IoT networks in this application where WiFi is not really even necessary in
                            the first place. This network makes it so WiFi is only used for commands and instructions that need
                            WiFi to communicate with an outside device, leaving the rest up to the Low Power Bluetooth network
                            made up of inexpensive ESP32 devices.
        
                            Taking on a demanding project like this was a risk. I was unsure at the start if I would be able to
                            do much if not any of the action items I described above. My work paid off in many ways: I now am
                            more experienced with conceptualizing, planning, and executing a project on a realistic timeline,
                            and I have a project I can carry on developing outside of class.
                            For me, these are very important to my career. I want to build technologies and systems that people
                            can use alongside my engineering career. I believe being able to bring a project from start to
                            finish by yourself requires discipline that is only obtained by doing it, going through the process.
                            This discipline is what this class taught me.
        
                            The prompt was essentially to create an IoT device using a microcontroller platform such as Arduino.
                            My project was much more complicated than that, creating five separate fully functional IoT devices
                            using the ESP32 microcontroller development board, and then creating an IoT network, Android App,
                            and Web Server using my own connection protocol to connect them all. I could have developed
                            something simpler, but I knew my potential, and worked to maximize what I was capable of creating
                            under these conditions.

                            I feel most accomplished with the fact that I stuck with my original goals (with some slight
                            alterations) instead of simplifying my project just to get an easy A. My goal was to create
                            something worthwhile that would grant me more than a good grade, and I believe under the conditions
                            this class provided I have achieved that goal.

The course is divided in two parts. In the first part, the students will follow a guided set of assignments to consolidate the concepts learnt in the related networking courses. The instructor in class will review these concepts and the students will learn how to apply them in a practical environment. Then, a novel embedded system board will be utilized to implement well-known protocols for both wired and wireless networks. In the second part, the students will design, implement and evaluate state-of-the-art and novel networking protocols for real-world application scenarios that each group will come up with. This course will provide the students with the necessary skills to not only theoretically understand but also practically contribute to the development of our internetworked society.

                        <h1>Reflection 4: EE 550 - Photovoltaic Technology, Professor Ian R. Sellers</h1>
                        <p class="justified-text">
        
                            I enrolled in EE 550 expecting to deepen my understanding of photovoltaic (PV) technology beyond the
                            surface-level knowledge I had gained from prior coursework and projects. I had previously worked
                            with solar panels in my senior design project, where I became familiar with key characteristics such
                            as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and the
                            equivalent circuit representation of solar cells as a current source with diode behavior. However,
                            this class introduced me to a far more nuanced perspective—one that made me re-think how I
                            critically assess emerging technologies and the claims made in research and the industry.
        
                            One of the most significant takeaways from this course was learning to approach new photovoltaic
                            technologies with a more critical mindset. In 2021, I wrote a paper on perovskite solar cells, a
                            technology widely hailed for its potential to revolutionize the solar industry due to its high
                            efficiency, tunable bandgap, and low-cost fabrication. At the time, my research was based on recent
                            publications that portrayed perovskites as the next major leap in solar power. While I acknowledged
                            concerns regarding their stability and service life, I largely focused on their advantages and
                            future prospects. However, in EE 550, I gained a more balanced and skeptical perspective on the
                            practical feasibility of perovskite-based photovoltaics.
        
                            Through discussions with Professor Sellers during class, I learned that much of the excitement
                            surrounding perovskites is fueled by highly selective data, with many research papers presenting
                            only the most optimistic results while glossing over fundamental reliability issues. For example,
                            while perovskite solar cells can demonstrate efficiencies exceeding 25\% in controlled lab
                            environments, their long-term stability is a major concern. Many perovskite cells degrade within
                            weeks, far from the decades-long service life expected from commercial solar panels. Additionally,
                            yield reporting in perovskite manufacturing is often absent, meaning that while individual cells may
                            be inexpensive to produce, the true cost skyrockets if hundreds must be fabricated to obtain a
                            single functional unit.
        
                            This realization reshaped my view of technological hype in renewable energy. While innovations are
                            necessary to advance solar power, the premature excitement surrounding some emerging technologies
                            can lead to unrealistic expectations and, ultimately, public distrust when those technologies fail
                            to deliver on exaggerated promises. It is crucial to distinguish between lab-scale success and
                            real-world viability, considering not only efficiency but also manufacturing scalability, stability,
                            and deployment challenges.
        
                            I wrote a paper on Perovskite usage in solar panels in 2021. My report adresses some of the issues
                            mentioned here, but it glances over the more concerning fact that perovskites are not proven to have
                            a suitable service life for Photovoltaic panels. My report written on perovskites can be accessed
                            via this link:
                            <a href="https://marcaura.github.io/MarcusFrancisco/pdfs/perovskites.pdf" target="_blank">Perovskite
                                Solar Cells Report</a>
        
                            What I found in this class was a more realistic view on how useful perovskites are for widespread
                            use. Professor Sellers was able to look past the hype, and was not easily convinced of perovskite
                            panel feasibility like I was in years prior.
        
                            Beyond perovskites, this course also provided valuable insight into the engineering and design
                            principles behind PV systems. One particularly interesting topic was the role of boost converters in
                            photovoltaic applications. As I am simultaneously studying power electronics in another course, I
                            found it fascinating to see the direct application of DC-DC converters in maximizing the efficiency
                            of solar energy conversion. Boost converters are commonly used in PV systems to step up the voltage
                            from solar panels while maintaining maximum power transfer through MPPT algorithms. This connection
                            between power electronics and photovoltaics reinforced how interdisciplinary renewable energy
                            systems truly are.
        
                            Another key takeaway was the complexity of integrating solar power into the electrical grid. Many
                            people assume that the main challenge with solar power is simply storing excess energy to compensate
                            for intermittency. While energy storage is important, EE 550 introduced me to the numerous technical
                            and economic challenges beyond just storage. These include grid stability, voltage regulation, power
                            electronics for grid interconnection, and the impact of variable solar generation on traditional
                            power infrastructure.
        
                            Overall, EE 550 has significantly refined my critical thinking when evaluating solar technologies.
                            It has taught me to question the sustainability and practicality of emerging PV solutions rather
                            than accepting optimistic projections at face value. While I still believe that perovskites and
                            other next-generation materials may play a role in the future of solar energy, I now understand the
                            importance of long-term reliability, economic feasibility, and scalable manufacturing as key factors
                            in determining whether a new technology will succeed beyond the laboratory.
        
                            This course has not only strengthened my technical understanding of photovoltaics but also provided
                            me with a more grounded perspective—one that will be invaluable in my career as an engineer working
                            in renewable energy. Moving forward, I will continue to approach emerging technologies with a
                            balance of curiosity and skepticism, ensuring that my assessments are based on both scientific rigor
                            and real-world viability.

                        <h2>Introduction to Tapecon and its FHE Evolution</h2>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Tapecon is a company that has produced tape, stickers, adhesives, prints, and various other products throughout 
                            most of its history. Recently, Tapecon has begun leveraging its expertise in adhesives and printing to produce 
                            Flexible Hybrid Electronics (FHE)—a new category of electronics that integrates printed circuits on flexible dielectric sheets 
                            rather than using traditional rigid circuit boards. This approach allows for thin, compact, and flexible electronics that have applications 
                            in wearable technology, medical devices, and industrial automation.

                        <h2>Designing Printed Circuitry for FHE</h2>
                    
                        <p class="justified-text">
                            The FHE design process begins with high-resolution film printing, followed by UV exposure to create a negative 
                            of the circuit design. A fine stainless-steel mesh coated in UV-sensitive resin is used to apply conductive ink, which 
                            seeps through the unexposed areas, forming the conductive traces on PET plastic or paper substrates.

                            The resulting conductive patterns allow for surface-mount component placement, enabling the creation of fully functional 
                            electronic circuits without the bulky form factor of traditional PCBs.

                            One of the main challenges in FHE development is achieving sustainability while maintaining efficiency. Traditional PCBs 
                            use large amounts of metal and non-recyclable materials, whereas FHE circuits can be printed with small amounts of 
                            conductive inks on flexible substrates, reducing waste.

                            One of my first projects involved designing an FHE flood detector circuit using only a BJT transistor and conductive 
                            traces. The industry standard for flood detection circuits requires a 3-inch circuit board, but I was able to reduce the 
                            footprint to less than a half-inch while maintaining full functionality.

                        As electrical engineers, it’s common knowledge how transistors work, how their characteristics affect circuits and how important their properties are when designing digital circuits. However, the more nuanced knowledge is in the specifics. How are transistors manufactured that creates such properties? Why do we as engineers need to design for components with variance in characteristics. In undergraduate work, we are taught that transistors may have vastly different

In this graduate course, we are shown the principles behind why integrated circuits are designed the way they are, what new and interesting effects are observed when looking at such a small scale, and how we are able to procure designs that are not only functional, but feasible to produce with constraints of size, budget, and performance.

                        An example of the nuance of digital circuit design can be seen in the layout of transistors in an integrated circuit. Let’s first look at the simple BJT used in the following circuit. 
                        
                        [IMAGE OF A BJT]
                        
                        This circuit has a I-V curve [DROPDOWN OF GRAPH] that is common for a single BJT device. Inside the BJT circuit element is a PN junction layout that looks like this:
                        
                        [IMAGE OF PN JUNCTION BJT - Marcus Francisco]
                        
                        The terminals each attach to the [], [], and [] respectively, and the circuit behaves predictable in accordance with the IV curve mentioned above. 
                        
                        Let’s now look at a more complex MOSFET integrated circuit. This hypothetical circuit must fit within a []nm scale, contain [] mosfets, it must be able to operate at a certain frequency with a set propagation delay, and each mosfet must cost less than [] Approximate values of the cost and function of these circuits are inspired by the following sources [CITATION OF SOURCE AND SAHOO LECTURES]
                        
                        This layout is on such a small scale that capacitances between the terminals are now relevant. We must factor those into our calculations when determining the performance and capabilities of this circuit. Also, because we are limited by size, we must be clever with where we place each junction. A common practice is to overlap the doped silicon regions to create multiple MOSFETS with less doped material. [GIF OF MOSFET LAYOUTS WITH AND WITHOUT THIS DESIGN ASPECT]
                        
                        The knowledge it takes to optimize digital integrated circuits in this way is what this class was meant to teach. There are many other aspects that come into play in this course as well. [DESCRIBE MATERIAL FROM WORK]
                        
                        I have excelled in digital circuits, logic, and microelectronics in my undergraduate work, and for me the next step was to continue my education about digital circuits into my graduate work. I plan to pursue a career in digital design, so this education will align very well with my future work. 
                        Something I learned about this subject is that there may be complex algorithms and tools that are used to optimize structures, however much of this field still requires a human touch. In an FPGA device, there may be a computation architecture for most purposes in creating a program, however there are also what are referred to as “Math Blocks” that are designed specifically for certain repeated functions. These are developed with purpose and great attention to detail in order to yield a block that can perform the repeated task with great speed and reduced space usage on the integrated circuit.
                        
                        Most of the challenges I encountered in this class were in using software. Cadence is the program we used most frequently to simulate circuits and perform analysis. This program could only be used on UB computers, and students needed to remote-in to use the program. I find I improved most in my ability to be effective in using this complex program within the limitations of a remote system. While not within the scope of the class itself, I also learned a lot about how to operate using the Linux operating system, which will be helpful down the line should I need to use Linux or Cadence again in my career. 
                        
                        I expected much of this course to be designing for digital logic using known optimization principles. I expected to see a circuit that I thought had been sufficiently optimized and then be informed that there were ways to make things even more efficient at using available resources. What surprised me is that sometimes the optimization took meticulous trial and error testing out many possible configurations, and even the simplest of logic could require hours of careful calculation and simulation. When I expected to be figuring out how to optimize a 3-bit multiplier circuit or something more complex, what I found is that it takes an entire class period to go through all the possible considerations in a single 4-bit ripple carry adder.
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        The course’s most powerful contribution to my understanding came through the in-depth exploration of Logical Effort. Prior to this class, I was vaguely aware of the need to optimize digital paths—but here, I learned how to rigorously quantify delay across multi-stage circuits and evaluate delay contributions from logical, electrical, and parasitic sources. The equation
                        d
                        =
                        g
                        h
                        +
                        p
                        d=gh+pbecame a guiding principle throughout the semester. We used it not just for theoretical calculations, but also to design fast datapaths and reason through fanout, stage effort, and gate sizing at a high level. This gave me a practical framework for building timing-aware digital systems—something I will absolutely carry forward in industry settings.
                        One of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences was Mini Project 1, where we designed a shift-and-accumulate processing core from scratch. This project tied together a barrel shifter, a pipelined adder tree, memory blocks, a synchronous counter, and control logic—all synthesized and verified as a cohesive system. The goal was to replicate the behavior of a simplified neural network accelerator, where 16 inputs and 16 coefficients are processed in parallel. This was not only technically demanding but also helped reinforce why performance and area optimization are critical in modern processor design.
                        Designing this project demanded a solid understanding of pipeline register placement, bit-width propagation, and clock-domain synchronization—skills that I had only briefly touched in previous coursework. Debugging timing issues during simulation also revealed the real-world complexities that can emerge even when logic seems functionally correct. We saw firsthand how barrel shifter output bit-width decisions influenced the datapath, and how improper sizing at even one point could propagate errors downstream.
                        Additionally, lectures on gate sizing and delay minimization opened my eyes to the subtle tradeoffs in circuit design. It’s not always best to minimize the number of stages—sometimes inserting more stages with appropriately sized gates yields lower total delay. This concept, grounded in the method of logical effort, was a paradigm shift for me. We analyzed example designs, including a FO4 inverter path, a decoder for a 16-word register file, and explored why NAND gates tend to be more efficient than NOR gates in CMOS logic. The use of spreadsheets to calculate optimal stage effort and input capacitances showed how engineers bring mathematical clarity to practical design constraints.
                        In reflection, this course fundamentally deepened my perspective on digital design. It moved me beyond surface-level knowledge of how digital circuits behave into a deeper appreciation of why they behave that way, and how best to manipulate and refine that behavior for real-world systems. Whether I pursue embedded systems, ASIC design, or hardware acceleration for AI, the principles I’ve learned in EE550 will be immediately relevant.
                        I also walked away with unexpected gains—especially in my comfort with Cadence tools, Linux remote environments, and waveform debugging. These skills were not the primary focus of the syllabus, but they became essential to completing our designs, and they reflect a broader lesson: in this field, no tool or concept exists in isolation. Each piece connects, overlaps, and reinforces the others.
                        As I prepare to graduate and transition into full-time engineering work, this class stands out as one of the most formative. It was humbling, intense, and intellectually rich—and it left me with both the confidence and curiosity to continue learning long after grades are assigned.

                    This course introduces the modeling, analysis, and design of industrial control systems. Topics include classical control theory, state-space methods, pole placement, system stability, and observer design. Students learn to analyze and implement control strategies through simulations and projects using MATLAB, Simulink, and real-world scenarios.


                    A core highlight of this course was exploring the control system behind an inverted pendulum—a classic and unstable dynamic system that can only be stabilized with real-time feedback control. I used a web-based simulator to experiment with pole placement and controller gains, which helped reinforce theoretical concepts from lecture.

                    Beyond the control systems content, this class unexpectedly helped me close a longstanding gap in my education: linear algebra. I had always focused more on MATLAB-based courses, but this class revisited key matrix concepts in a rigorous way. I especially appreciated Professor Herrera’s use of chalk during the linear algebra review, which made me more engaged and attentive than any slides could.

IE 512LEC,        Decision Analysis             Jun Zhuang

Decision analysis was both interesting and relevant to my life in ways beyond my education and career. This course helps to [GIVE GOOD OVERVEIW OF CLASS], and the overall idea is to provide a structure and reason upon which to base complex decisions where the right answer is not always clear. The class culminates in a final project where you use all the acquired skills throughout the semester in attempting to perform decision analysis on a decision of your choosing. My project is relevant to me for a personal reason. In Fall of 2024 I was told my by doctor that I have many of the warning signs for Thyroid cancer. I had abnormal blood thyroglobulin levels, and was informed by an ENT that I was a 4/5 on the TiRADS thyroid cancer risk assessment scale. I was unsure of what all the statistics meant at the time, and was understandably panicked at the now very real possibility of going through my last year of college as a cancer patient. Through research and consultation with many doctors, I was able to more adequately understand the numbers and the diagnosis. Thus, I decided to make my final project a decision tree, sensitivity analysis, and decision analysis of what actions to take when diagnosed with a thyroid nodule. 
[EMBED POWERPOINT, DECISION TREES, AND FINAL PRESENTATION]
This ended up being a great choice of project material, since I had already done extensive research on thyroid cancer, and was visiting thyroid surgeons and specialists to acquire the most accurate information I could. My goal was to be the most informed on the condition and on my choices as I possibly could, and I was invested in making this project useful as I was personally going through this difficult choice during that semester. 

Decision Analysis Class:

[Decision Analysis Reflection]

In IE 512, we were taught to construct structured decision-making models for real-world problems, incorporating probabilities, utilities, and sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertain outcomes. The course introduced fundamental tools such as decision trees, influence diagrams, and Bayes’ theorem. These tools allowed me to better define problems, quantify risks and outcomes, and identify optimal decisions under uncertainty. Our professor, Dr. Jun Zhuang, emphasized using these models not merely as theoretical exercises but as practical guides for high-stakes decision-making. My experience using this methodology—on a problem that impacted my own life—demonstrated how profoundly valuable decision analysis can be in navigating ambiguity. I learned to balance data with values, and weigh expected utility not just in survival years, but in quality of life and mental health. These lessons extended beyond academic exercises into deeply personal terrain, and helped me make peace with the choice I ultimately made.
In this project, my brother and I created a decision tree to evaluate options for a patient diagnosed with a thyroid nodule. The two main alternatives we analyzed were surgical thyroidectomy and active monitoring. Each path contained chance nodes accounting for malignancy, surgical complications, hormone replacement side effects, and cancer progression. We used real statistics to assign probabilities to each outcome. For example, the overall 5-year relative survival rate for thyroid cancer is 98.4%, but drops to 51.9% if distant metastasis occurs {CITE SOURCE: “SEER Cancer Stat Facts: Thyroid Cancer”}. We also created an influence diagram that visualized how expert opinion, patient symptoms, and malignancy interact in a dynamic system of feedback loops. Our analysis helped reveal a non-obvious truth: sometimes waiting is the optimal choice. While surgery provides a definitive diagnosis, the lifelong tradeoff of hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against the low but real risk of malignancy for small or indeterminate nodules (e.g., 10.5% for nodules 1–1.9cm, and 15% for those >4cm) {CITE SOURCE: “Kamran et al., 2013”}.
We modeled patient utility not only in terms of life expectancy but also in mental health. To do this, we developed a double-objective framework that weighted outcomes by both longevity and psychological burden. Our tornado and spider graphs showed that longevity was the dominant driver of expected value, but mental well-being had a meaningful effect, especially when dealing with uncertainty or repeated inconclusive biopsy results. When both longevity and mental health were weighted together, we found the optimal strategies were those that prioritized early specialist consultation and careful monitoring over aggressive surgical intervention—unless cancer was clearly suspected. See Figure 1 for our final decision tree and Figure 2 for the influence diagram.[Insert: Figure 1 – Final Decision Tree][Insert: Figure 2 – Final Influence Diagram][Insert: Figure 3 – Spider Graph or Tornado Chart]
Ultimately, this project taught me how to bring clarity to a deeply ambiguous real-world challenge. It wasn’t just an exercise in numbers or decision theory—it gave me language and structure to think through the most important decision of my life to date. I now understand what it means to weigh tradeoffs under uncertainty, how to identify meaningful objectives, and how to respect the influence of both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. This course helped me become not just a better decision-maker, but a more analytical and self-aware individual during a deeply emotional time.

My Experience with a Thyroid Condition:

The most central challenge to this problem is that doctors cannot diagnose thyroid cancer with certainty without removing the organ. There are scans, blood tests, MRIs, CT scans, Ultrasound, needle aspiration biopsies, and physical exams that can give us clues, but none tell us for certain weather or not you have cancer. I underwent each one of these tests, and at the time I was holding out hope that one of them would tell me for sure that I don’t have cancer, but that did not happen. Scans like the MRI and CT were done with and without contrast. Interestingly, these scans were taken of my thyroid (neck) and my sinuses and maxilofacial region in one go. For that reason, I my mouth was stuffed with gauze to maintain contrast between the soft palate and the tongue during the duration of the scan, where I was required to keep completely still for 50 minutes. 
I soon came to understand what TiRADS means, [insert explaination], and I understood the nuance of what thyroglobulin levels indicate. Through my journey making decisions about this condition for myself, I discovered more of the mistakes one may make along the way. One of the pitfalls I found is going into surgery to remove the thyroid prematurely. The rate of thyroid nodules in the population is upwards of 60%, while the incidence of cancer is only []% {Cite Source}. This along with an indeterminant biopsy diagnosis results in a tough decision. I had an inconclusive biopsy, which ,exams the choice to go into surgery is ultimately up to me. Without all the information, you need to consider what statistics are available, and make a decision based on the limited information and the likely incidence of cancer for your set of symptoms. The trouble is that going into surgery means removing the thyroid, which means you will need to undergo hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. If you remove the thyroid suspecting cancer, but after the fact discover that no cancer was present, you’ve removed an important organ from your body permanently and it was unnecessary. 57% of Thyroidectomy surgeries result in this outcome. [CITATION] The feeling of discovering you just underwent an unnecessary life altering surgery is difficult to describe for patients, but I have heard it described as a mixture of happiness and regret. You’re pleased because now you know for certain that you don’t have cancer, but you lament the fact that you did not need to remove the thyroid and now need hormone replacement therapy. This choice has implications beyond the simple cancer diagnosis. If you keep getting indeterminant biopsies like I did my first three visits you are forced to live with the idea that you must choose the right option. You need to walk around every day with the knowledge that you may have cancer and are choosing not to have it removed. It is impossible to say if this alternate possibility is better than hormone replacement, but the psychological impact of this decision is quite significant. My case was not severe by most metrics, but I still found I was unable to focus in class, and was constantly researching thyroid cancer, trying to figure out my rate of survival given each course of action.
Consulting with a thyroid surgeon was an absolute must. He gave me the much needed clarity to form a decision. I was given a through explanation of the condition and all the deciding factors, a conversation that lasted over an hour. I was given the choice to get another biopsy or to monitor with ultrasound. I knew that statistically speaking the it is very unlikely that next biopsy will provide useful results after several non-diagnostic tests. I asked about alternative biopsies such as surgical or core-needle biopsies. These both have their own set of severe drawbacks. A surgical biopsy is considered so dangerous it is no longer permitted in the medical field, due to the likelihood that the lyrangeal nerve will be damaged or severed. A core needle biopsy uses a larger needle, introducing more risks, longer recovery, and a risk to damage the carotid artery. I eventually proposed the idea of draining fluid during a traditional fine needle aspiration biopsy. This would make the nodule behave less cystic (fluid filled) and possibly make the tissue easier to collect inside the needle. I was nervous to ask the interventional radiologist to try something different that I hadn’t even heard of online, but I was determined to find a different strategy to improve my chances. I am pleased to report that my latest biopsy came back with more conclusive results. It was characterized and is associated with a far lower risk of cancer than the odds I was given back in September of 2024. I reflect on reading these results and consider how close I was to choosing surgery. In November of 2024 I was certain that my appointment with the surgeon would result in booking a surgery. By January of 2025 I had a more concrete understanding of the condition and made the right decision regarding surgery vs active monitoring.
