                        This reflection explores my experience in EE 519, a course that challenged and inspired me
                        through hands-on control system modeling, interactive simulations, and valuable instruction on
                        LaTeX and state-space design. One of the most memorable parts was experimenting with the
                        inverted pendulum system to visualize stability and control principles.

                            Exploring Control Systems Through Simulation
                        </h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            This course introduces the modeling, analysis, and design of industrial control systems.
                            Topics include classical control theory, state-space methods, pole placement, system
                            stability, and observer design. Students learn to analyze and implement control strategies
                            through simulations and projects using MATLAB, Simulink, and real-world scenarios.


                            A core highlight of this course was exploring the control system behind an inverted
                            pendulum—a classic and unstable dynamic system that can only be stabilized with real-time
                            feedback control. I used a web-based simulator to experiment with pole placement and
                            controller gains, which helped reinforce theoretical concepts from lecture. Let's first have
                            a look at a simple pendulum in this type of simulator. The following simulator was developed
                            in JSFiddle [<a class="hyperlink-citation" href="citations.html#citation5">5</a>], but
                            siumulation in class was done primarily in MatLAB and Simulink.

                            Simulations like this one allowed me to intuitively explore the effects of varying
                            controller gain
                            values on the pendulum's stability. It's a great complement to the mathematics behind
                            state-space design and control. Through this, I grasped abstract topics like controllability
                            and observability in a more tangible way. The pendulum was brought up multiple times in
                            class, and we had to represent a pendulum as a state space system in quizzes during class. A
                            more advanced control system setup is used to create what is called an "Inverted Pendulum".
                            The following inverted pendulum simulator was also developed in JSFiddle [<a
                                class="hyperlink-citation" href="citations.html#citation4">4</a>] based on a simulator
                            created by Oscar Saharoy [<a class="hyperlink-citation"
                                href="citations.html#citation6">6</a>].

                            Beyond the control systems content, this class also helped me close a gap in my education:
                            linear algebra. In my undergraduate education, I had opted for the MATLAB-based course for
                            linear algebra instead of the dedicated class for linear algebra. As someone who
                            specializes in embedded systems and controls, I took the course for MatLab instead of Linear
                            Algebra. I feel my MatLAB knowledge is greatly useful in my major, but I have been needing a
                            more in depth course on linear algebra. This class revisited key matrix concepts in a
                            rigorous way, filling in the gaps. I recall Professor Herrra decided to try something
                            different and used chalk to teach the
                            linear algebra review. I really appreciate using chalk for teaching mathematics, and I found
                            myself taking more detailed notes and paying attention to every detail.

                        <h5 class="reflection-heading">LaTeX Report Writing</h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Another pleasant surprise came from learning how to properly use LaTeX. While initially
                            using it for just one
                            report in this class, I found myself producing professional-quality IEEE reports for all my
                            courses by the
                            end of the semester. I attribute this new affinity for LaTeX mainly to this class inspiring
                            me
                            to use LaTeX and Overleaf in all my courses.

                            Professor Herrera incentivised the use of LaTeX by giving bonus points for reports written
                            with it. This course pushed me to improve my syntax, formatting, and confidence in
                            scientific communication.
                            I feel confident that I work more efficiently and
                            effectively in report writing than I ever was in other software. Typing professional reports
                            in LaTeX is one of the most important skills I’ve learned in my graduate career. As a result
                            of this course and Professor Herrera encouraging the use of LaTeX I now use this language
                            for
                            all my reports.

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            What I valued most in EE 519 was how it brought together theoretical math, real-world
                            engineering systems, and modern tools like MATLAB, Simulink, and LaTeX. It gave me a
                            systems-level
                            mindset that developed over the course of the semester.
                            Learning how to model a system in state space—breaking
                            it down into matrices that describe its evolution—gave me a framework I can now apply across
                            disciplines, from robotics to analog circuits.
                            This is the difference between working to just solve a system of equations and modeling
                            something to properly understand a complex system. The shift from pure mathematics to system
                            modeling has made me a more capable engineer and thoughtful problem solver.

                                hands-on experimentation with real-world implementations. The course is divided in two
                                parts. In the first part, the students will follow a guided set of assignments to
                                consolidate the concepts learnt in the related networking courses. The instructor in
                                class will review these concepts and the students will learn how to apply them in a
                                practical environment. Then, a novel embedded system board will be utilized to implement
                                well-known protocols for both wired and wireless networks. In the second part, the
                                students will design, implement and evaluate state-of-the-art and novel networking
                                protocols for real-world application scenarios that each group will come up with. This

                            I took EE 541 to dive into a completely new field within Electrical Engineering that piqued
                            my interest. I excel in mathematics and physics and have always been fascinated by the
                            "black-box magic" of deep learning. To me, calculus is clear-cut, motivated by the pursuit
                            of truth through numbers, while physics employs theoretical principles and laws to bring
                            order to an otherwise unpredictable world. However, at the time of taking this class, deep
                            learning seemed entirely different from these two subjects. Electrical Engineering is rooted
                            in mathematics, differential equations, and physics, all governed by well-defined laws. At
                            first glance, artificial intelligence and machine learning appeared far less structured,
                            relying on unknown weights in a neural network.

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Neural networks operate in a way that more closely resembles the human brain than
                            traditional circuits. Seen above is a basic demonstration of how a neural network works.
                            Neural networks are made up of layers of interconnected nodes, often referred to as
                            "neurons". These nodes process and transmit information from one place to another. Each
                            neuron applies a weighted sum of its inputs, passes it through an activation function, and
                            propagates the result forward through the network. Adjusting these weights based on training
                            data allows a neural network to learn patterns and make predictions on future data. A common
                            application of neural networks is handwriting recognition. Below are a couple examples of
                            how to use a neural network from my first EE 541 project, where I trained a neural network
                            using a dataset of handwritten numbers known as MNIST. The MNIST dataset is a widely used
                            data repository of handwritten numbers. I've heard it referred to as the "Hello World" of
                            machine learning, that is to say it is to machine learning what printing "Hello World" would
                            be to a simple computer program. MNIST is used for training handwriting recognition systems,
                            much like the one discussed below.

                                network in classification tasks. Each digit is represented as a 28×28 grayscale
                                image, where pixel intensity values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white). The dataset

                                    Initially, the model makes random predictions, resulting in low accuracy. As
                                    training progresses, the optimizer adjusts the weights using gradient descent,
                                    reducing classification errors and increasing accuracy. The learning rate (lr),
                                    which is set to 0.000003 in this graph, controls the step size taken during weight
                                    updates. A small learning rate like this ensures gradual and stable convergence,
                                    preventing the model from overshooting the optimal solution. The curve typically
                                    exhibits a rapid rise in early epochs before stabilizing as the network converges to

                            this one. After this class, I knew I wanted to take another course with him. I thoroughly
                            enjoyed his teaching style, from his in-depth explanations to his ability to keep students
                            engaged—even offering protein shakes as incentives. I'd never seen a class of students so
                            eager to tell him the Nyquist sampling rate for a band-limited signal. He prefers using
                            chalk, which gives him an old-school approach that I really appreciate, particularly since
                            the content of this course was anything but old-school. This course was based on recent
                            engineering research, with some journal articles published the same year we studied them.
                            This made me excited to learn about an unfamiliar yet relevant topic from a professor whose

                            Grasping an Abstract Concept
                        </h5>

                        <p class="justified-text"> Deep learning can seem abstract, and understanding every facet of a
                            neural network may not be feasible. However, one can form an understanding of the principles
                            and methods used to achieve its design. Neural networks have hundreds or even thousands of
                            nodes and weights, adjusted through learning algorithms that we can build and understand.
                            However, determining why each weight changes and its precise effect on the output is
                            complex. A mathematician Grant Sanderson explains this well in his breakdown of neural
                            network behavior over successive training cycles. Sanderson goes over this explanation on
                            his channel called "3Blue1Brown" [<a class="hyperlink-citation"

                            mathematics and challenge myself in fields such as deep learning.

                        </h5>

                        <p class="justified-text"> Throughout the course, I struggled with the abstract nature of this
                            field. To tackle this, I had
                            to accept that fully comprehending every aspect of a deep learning module may not be
                            realistic.
                            Despite this, I was able to learn and design effective models. Over time, I gained a deeper
                            understanding of Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. Randomness plays a critical
                            role in
                            deep learning, often complicating things. However, this randomness is beneficial—it drives
                            educational exploration. A deep learning model must sometimes explore uncharted paths, even
                            if
                            the algorithm is uncertain whether the outcome will improve. This allows the model to
                            discover
                            new, potentially superior approaches.</p>


                        <p class="justified-text">This mirrors my experience in taking EE 541. Much like a neural
                            network making weight
                            adjustments based on limited knowledge, I ventured into an unfamiliar field unsure of my
                            success. Yet, by exploring deep learning, I have grown as an engineer. Much like a neural
                            network performing training to explore alternative options, I took a leap by enrolling in EE
                            541
                            without knowing whether or not I would excel. In the end, I believe I am better for it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="justified-text">Initially, I believed that deep learning was completely different from
                            the predictable,
                            theory-based mathematics I was comfortable with. However, having completed the course, I now
                            understand that this is not the case. A neural network and its teaching algorithm are
                            ultimately
                            just a complex system of equations, designed to adjust weights in a way that optimizes
                            outcomes.
                            In many ways, deep learning is an extension of traditional mathematical principles—it’s
                            simply
                            applied in a novel way.</p>

                            I entered the class for Microfabrication of Circuits excited to witness the fundamental
                            processes underlying Electrical Engineering. Much of my EE background and undergraduate
                            education is based on transistors, microelectronics, and the core principles of electrical
                            circuit behavior, including properties of current and voltage. From a broad perspective,
                            basic circuits with a DC source, resistors, and reactive components are easy to comprehend.
                            However, delving deeper into Electrical Engineering reveals complexities such as internal
                            resistance and forward biasing. While these phenomena can be analyzed through differential
                            equations and theoretical models, they are difficult to visualize, making direct observation
                            nearly impossible.

                            To witness microfabrication firsthand is to look behind the curtain, replacing conceptual
                            imagination with real-world experiences in the lab. Since learning how a computer worked in
                            elementary school, I had been eager to understand how computer chips, transistors, and
                            memory devices are made. This course provided a pivotal moment where all my undergraduate
                            Electrical Engineering studies converged into an opportunity to observe microfabrication
                            machines in action.

                            From there, we explored Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) and underwent the entire process of
                            using that machine. During my time in the cleanroom I also got to see an electron
                            microscope. These machines range in cost, and require extensive care, training, and
                            supervision to operate. To quote the University of Houston Nanofabrication Facility, "An
                            entry level EBL system costs approximately $1,000,000 and more expensive systems are
                            engineered to write faster and over larger areas." [<a class="hyperlink-citation"
                                href="citations.html#uhnf">9</a>] In the EBL process, we adhered specific metals to
                            silicon by first applying a thin 2um layer of platinum on the spin-coated silicon surface.
                            This platinum layer served as an intermediary to enhance the adhesion of gold, as gold
                            adheres poorly to silicon but bonds well to platinum.

                            One of the most fascinating properties we observed was the way incident light reflects off
                            gold nanoparticles. In EBL, an electron beam is directed at a filament of gold, platinum, or
                            another metal. The beam vaporizes the metal, and the vaporized material is then deposited
                            onto a surface in precise patterns. Using this method, we achieved deposition resolutions as
                            fine as 2um. One of our test samples deposited the names of our lab members on a silicon
                            wafer. This sample can be seen in the figure below shown under a microscope. The names are
                            present as a thin layer of gold, and the font is on a nanometer scale.

                            Gold nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent optical properties, allowing them to reflect
                            different frequencies of light. This phenomenon was historically used in ancient times in
                            stained glass windows, where molten glass mixed with gold nanoparticles produced vibrant red
                            hues. In our lab, we unintentionally observed this effect due to a unique occurrence in the
                            deposition process. The EBL machine uses clips to hold down the sample, which inadvertently
                            blocked some of the vaporized gold deposition. This obstruction created a gradient of gold
                            thickness across the sample.

                            An interesting observation was that this deposition gradient resulted in thicknesses below
                            the minimum deposition capability of the EBL machine. This created a visible color gradient
                            on the sample, which we attributed to the optical properties of gold nanoparticles. We had
                            initially assumed that the color gradient was an effect of the microscope, however upon
                            recalling the properties of gold nanoparticles and the effect particle size has on light, I
                            piped up and explained to our group that it must be a deposition thickness gradient. While
                            outside the scope of the class, me and my lab partners wrote about this effect in detail in
                            our final report. Having prior knowledge of the effect of gold nanoparticles, I contributed

                            Spin coating was another technique we utilized in our experiments. Spin coating is a
                            technique used in microfabrication to apply uniform thin films by depositing a liquid
                            solution onto a substrate and rapidly spinning it. The centrifugal force spreads the liquid

                            Getting suited up for the cleanroom was a unique experience. The "bunny suit" worn inside
                            the cleanroom is not for personal safety but rather to protect the sensitive materials and
                            equipment from contamination. Given the extreme sensitivity of these machines, all potential
                            contaminants, including dust and skin particles, must be contained within the suit. Each
                            suit comes in a sterilized plastic package, and we were trained to put them on in a way that
                            prevents external contamination. Before entering the cleanroom, we passed through an air
                            shower, which blasted pressurized air to remove any residual dust or contaminants.

                        I took EE 526 to challenge myself with a project that pushed the boundaries of what I had
                        previously built. This course gave me the freedom to design a fully integrated IoT network from
                        scratch, combining Bluetooth, WiFi, and Android development into one cohesive system. It
                        sharpened my technical skills, taught me to plan under tight constraints, and showed me the
                        value of building something truly useful from the ground up.

                            When deciding to take Wearable and Implantable Sensors, I considered the multiple projects
                            I’ve contributed to in the past. Multiple hackathon projects, independent works, and an
                            award-winning research project.

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I have worked on various projects in IoT, embedded systems, wireless communication, and
                            power electronics. I worked on 5G KPI analysis which examined the impact of weather on 5G
                            performance using a Raspberry Pi with a 5G hat, and a UPS system providing a cost-effective
                            backup power solution with deep-cycle batteries as part of my coursework. I also co-authored
                            a published research project on Interactive Digital Twins, presented at ACM SenSys ‘22. I
                            became team lead of this research project in 2023, worked on device firmware and
                            intercommunication, and we were awarded the Russel Agrusa Student Innovation Award.
                            Additionally, I contributed to multiple award-winning hackathon projects, such as a fire
                            prevention system, modular security system, and a plastic bottle recycling machine for 3D
                            printer filament. My work has refined my system design ability, knowledge on automation, and
                            real-time data processing.

                            All of these projects involved some degree of sensor usage. Combine this affinity for
                            projects using sensors with my love for Dr. Oh’s teaching style, and I knew at once I was
                            dead-set on taking this class. I learned in this class many specialized topics such as
                            microfluidics, accelerometers, inertial sensors, and recent developments in sensor
                            technology. EE526 provided background in the design, implementation, and optimization of
                            wearable and implantable sensor systems. The course covered covering microfluidics, wireless
                            communication, power management, biocompatibility, and data processing for biomedical and
                            IoT applications.

                            What I believe was most important is refining my ability to put thought and effort into
                            planning a project on a strict timeline. The projects Dr. Oh assigned were broad enough in
                            subject matter that you could select something you were genuinely interested in. For my
                            project, I chose to make a WiFi and Bluetooth IoT network with an Android app from scratch.
                            In completing this project, I achieved two main milestones that were not exactly course
                            requirements, but were necessary for the completion of my project. For my combination WiFi
                            and BLE project, I developed my own device connection and intercommunication protocol, and I
                            developed an android app having no prior knowledge on how to do so. These skills are not
                            directly related to wearable and implantable sensors, however they both were required to
                            complete the project. For this, I needed to take initiative and learn the skills needed to
                            complete each milestone.

                            To be clear, the class doesn’t cover app development, device wireless intercommunication,
                            firmware development, or some of the other tools needed to create my project I dubbed
                            "BlueLink", but Professor Oh urged that students figure out how to acquire the necessary
                            skills to complete project on their own time. I believe this was a great environment,
                            because it forced you to be more realistic about your project expectations, while also
                            getting you invested in project completion. This setup was very helpful to me since it
                            motivated me to start early since there were many uncertain factors in my project. What I
                            recommend for others taking this course is to aim big on the final project and begin scoping
                            out the skills and technologies needed to complete it very early. Dr. Oh gives you the
                            project prompt on the first day of class with the syllabus so you can start as early as the
                            first day.

                            For me, this meant exploring how to build an Android app, and also re-kindling the embers of
                            device intercommunication I acquired working on my research project in past years.
                            Beforehand, working for the ISE department, I was able to establish wired serial
                            communication between two devices with different microcontrollers and hardware. This project
                            presented a different challenge. I now need to establish bi-directional intercommunication
                            between two of the same type of device, (ESP32s), but now the devices operate with different
                            connection protocols. My work beforehand was two different types of hardware communicating,
                            but in this project two different types of firmware must communication. One ESP must
                            communicate via WiFi with the internet and the other must communicate via Bluetooth with the
                            WiFi device.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            The biggest challenge I encountered was programming one of these small, inexpensive devices
                            to use both BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and WiFi at the same time. This large challenge
                            concerned the amount of Flash Memory the devices have available. Flash memory on an ESP32 is
                            used to store the program code, libraries, and necessary data for execution, allowing the
                            microcontroller to retain firmware even after a power cycle. When a program exceeds the
                            available flash memory, the device may fail to compile, crash, or enter a reboot loop due to
                            insufficient storage. To accommodate for this, you can optimize memory usage by reducing the
                            program size (removing unused libraries, optimizing code, or using PROGMEM for constants),
                            increasing partition sizes in the ESP32’s partition table, or using external flash storage
                            for non-critical data.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            The device didn’t have enough flash memory to hold the program and execute it properly. The
                            infinite reboot loop is what my ESP32 devices did whenever I attempted to use both
                            communication types as the same time. This gave me a small hint that the ESP had enough
                            memory to store the program but not enough to run it. To fix this, I altered the partition
                            scheme and eventually found a configuration that would support my connection protocol.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Other challenges were power usage and optimizing data processing to draw less power and use
                            less memory. The two competing connection protocols caused the chip to draw too much power,
                            causing a "brownout" or low voltage shutdown, and the two types of communication deliver
                            messages in different formats. Command conversion was needed on the chip, and optimizing
                            this was crucial since I had a limited amount of power and space. At one point I realized I
                            was running too many ESP32 devices on one power supply, resulting in a brownout error. This
                            was a separate problem from the brownout shutdown I mentioned earlier. This problem was
                            amongst the easiest to solve since it only required I get another USB power supply, however
                            that didn't prevent the hours of troubleshooting through software before I discovered the
                            real cause of the problem.

                            My approach to problem solving here needed to be consistent and robust if I were to finish
                            this project on time. By this I mean I needed to implement changes iteratively, so most of
                            the time I am able to deduce the source of an error quickly and begin troubleshooting
                            immediately. If I implemented a hundred changes at once, finding issues would be more
                            similar to finding a needle in a haystack. I tackled each problem one at a time, testing
                            multiple devices each time to make sure the problems were not just a faulty chip. Problems
                            arising from manufacturing defects in the chips happened twice in this project. I
                            reallocated flash memory to program storage by changing the partition scheme, implemented
                            power-saving connection methods, and wrote my own command system specifically for this
                            setup.

                            What I am left with is an IoT network with multiple devices. It uses my own connection
                            protocol that I wrote, and since it uses both BLE and WiFi, local operations do not depend
                            on WiFi, so if a user's WiFi goes down, device intercommunication persists. An example of
                            where this would be useful is if you set up routines for a light or device to turn on and
                            off at a certain time, WiFi dependence may become a cumbersome for IoT networks in this
                            application where WiFi is not really even necessary in the first place. This network makes
                            it so WiFi is only used for commands and instructions that need WiFi to communicate with an
                            outside device, leaving the rest up to the Low Power Bluetooth network made up of
                            inexpensive ESP32 devices.

                            Taking on a demanding project like this was a risk. I was unsure at the start if I would be
                            able to do much if not any of the action items I described above. My work paid off in many
                            ways: I now am more experienced with conceptualizing, planning, and executing a project on a
                            realistic timeline, and I have a project I can carry on developing outside of class. For me,
                            these are very important to my career. I want to build technologies and systems that people
                            can use alongside my engineering career. I believe being able to bring a project from start
                            to finish by yourself requires discipline that is only obtained by doing it, going through
                            the process. This discipline is what this class taught me.

                            The prompt was essentially to create an IoT device using a microcontroller platform such as
                            Arduino. My project was much more complicated than that, creating five separate fully
                            functional IoT devices using the ESP32 microcontroller development board, and then creating
                            an IoT network, Android App, and Web Server using my own connection protocol to connect them
                            all. I could have developed something simpler, but I knew my potential, and worked to
                            maximize what I was capable of creating under these conditions.

                            shown to the class can be seen here above. I feel most accomplished with the fact that I

                            I enrolled in EE 550 expecting to deepen my understanding of photovoltaic (PV) technology
                            beyond the surface-level knowledge I had gained from prior coursework and projects. I had
                            previously worked with solar panels in my senior design project, where I became familiar
                            with key characteristics such as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, maximum power
                            point tracking (MPPT), and the equivalent circuit representation of solar cells as a current
                            source with diode behavior. However, this class introduced me to a far more nuanced
                            perspective—one that made me re-think how I critically assess emerging technologies and the
                            claims made in research and the industry.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            One of the most significant takeaways from this course was learning to approach new
                            photovoltaic technologies with a more critical mindset. In 2021, I wrote a paper on
                            perovskite solar cells, a technology widely hailed for its potential to revolutionize the
                            solar industry due to its high efficiency, tunable bandgap, and low-cost fabrication. At the
                            time, my research was based on recent publications that portrayed perovskites as the next
                            major leap in solar power. While I acknowledged concerns regarding their stability and
                            service life, I largely focused on their advantages and future prospects. However, in EE
                            550, I gained a more balanced and skeptical perspective on the practical feasibility of
                            perovskite-based photovoltaics.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Through discussions with Professor Sellers during class, I learned that much of the
                            excitement surrounding perovskites is fueled by highly selective data, with many research
                            papers presenting only the most optimistic results while glossing over fundamental
                            reliability issues. For example, while perovskite solar cells can demonstrate efficiencies
                            exceeding 25% in controlled lab environments, their long-term stability is a major concern.
                            Many perovskite cells degrade within weeks, far from the decades-long service life expected
                            from commercial solar panels. Additionally, yield reporting in perovskite manufacturing is
                            often absent, meaning that while individual cells may be inexpensive to produce, the true
                            cost skyrockets if hundreds must be fabricated to obtain a single functional unit.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            This realization reshaped my view of technological hype in renewable energy. While
                            innovations are necessary to advance solar power, the premature excitement surrounding some
                            emerging technologies can lead to unrealistic expectations and, ultimately, public distrust
                            when those technologies fail to deliver on exaggerated promises. It is crucial to
                            distinguish between lab-scale success and real-world viability, considering not only
                            efficiency but also manufacturing scalability, stability, and deployment challenges.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I wrote a paper on Perovskite usage in solar panels in 2021. My report addresses some of the
                            issues mentioned here, but it glances over the more concerning fact that perovskites are not
                            proven to have a suitable service life for Photovoltaic panels. My report written on
                            perovskites overlooked many of the shortcomings and focused mainly on the potential to
                            improve cell efficiency.

                            What I found in this class was a more realistic view on how useful perovskites are for
                            widespread use. Professor Sellers was able to look past the hype, and was not easily
                            convinced of perovskite panel feasibility like I was in years prior.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Beyond perovskites, this course also provided valuable insight into the engineering and
                            design principles behind PV systems. One particularly interesting topic was the role of
                            boost converters in photovoltaic applications. As I am simultaneously studying power
                            electronics in another course, I found it fascinating to see the direct application of DC-DC
                            converters in maximizing the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Boost converters are
                            commonly used in PV systems to step up the voltage from solar panels while maintaining
                            maximum power transfer through MPPT algorithms. This connection between power electronics
                            and photovoltaics reinforced how interdisciplinary renewable energy systems truly are.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Another key takeaway was the complexity of integrating solar power into the electrical grid.
                            Many people assume that the main challenge with solar power is simply storing excess energy
                            to compensate for intermittency. While energy storage is important, EE 550 introduced me to
                            the numerous technical and economic challenges beyond just storage. These include grid
                            stability, voltage regulation, power electronics for grid interconnection, and the impact of
                            variable solar generation on traditional power infrastructure.

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Overall, EE 550 has significantly refined my critical thinking when evaluating solar
                            technologies. It has taught me to question the sustainability and practicality of emerging
                            PV solutions rather than accepting optimistic projections at face value. While I still
                            believe that perovskites and other next-generation materials may play a role in the future
                            of solar energy, I now understand the importance of long-term reliability, economic
                            feasibility, and scalable manufacturing as key factors in determining whether a new
                            technology will succeed beyond the laboratory.

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            This course has not only strengthened my technical understanding of photovoltaics but also
                            provided me with a more grounded perspective—one that will be invaluable in my career as an
                            engineer working in renewable energy. Moving forward, I will continue to approach emerging
                            technologies with a balance of curiosity and skepticism, ensuring that my assessments are
                            based on both scientific rigor and real-world viability.

                            understandably panicked at the now very real possibility of going through my last year of
                            college as a cancer patient.

                            Through research and consultation with many doctors, I was able to more adequately

                            decision tree, sensitivity analysis, and decision analysis of what actions to take when

                            In our project, we modeled utility in terms of both life expectancy and psychological
                            impact. Our double-objective framework allowed us to weight not just survival time, but also
                            mental burden. We learned that longevity is the dominant utility driver, but mental health
                            has meaningful weight—especially in cases with inconclusive test results.

                        <h5>My Experience with a Thyroid Condition</h5>
                        <p class="justified-text">
                            The most central challenge to this problem is that doctors cannot diagnose thyroid cancer
                            with certainty without removing the organ. There are scans, blood tests, MRIs, CT scans,
                            Ultrasound, needle aspiration biopsies, and physical exams that can give us clues, but none
                            tell us for certain weather or not you have cancer. I underwent each one of these tests, and
                            at the time I was holding out hope that one of them would tell me for sure that I don’t have
                            cancer, but that did not happen. Scans like the MRI and CT were done with and without
                            contrast, making them time consuming. Interestingly, these scans were taken of my thyroid
                            (neck) and my sinuses and maxilofacial region in one go. For that reason, I my mouth was
                            stuffed with gauze to maintain contrast between the soft palate and the tongue during the
                            duration of the scan, where I was required to keep completely still for 50 minutes.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I soon came to understand what TiRADS means, a radiologic scoring system used to assess the
                            risk of thyroid nodule malignancy, and I understood the nuance of what thyroglobulin levels
                            indicate. Through my journey making decisions about this condition for myself, I discovered
                            more of the mistakes one may make along the way. One of the pitfalls I found is going into
                            surgery to remove the thyroid prematurely. A thyroidectomy leads to the need for lifelong
                            hormone replacement therapy, even when no cancer is present. In fact, 56% of surgeries for
                            indeterminate nodules in certain populations turn out to have been unnecessary [<a
                                class="hyperlink-citation" href="citations.html#farwell">18</a>].
                        </p>

                        <h5>So.. Should I Remove the Organ?</h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Indeterminant biopsy results face you with a tough decision. I had an inconclusive biopsy,
                            which means the choice to go into surgery is ultimately up to me. Without all the
                            information, you need to consider what statistics are available, and make a decision based
                            on the limited information and the likely incidence of cancer for your set of symptoms.

                            I faced the difficult reality of choosing between living with the possibility of cancer and
                            undergoing a permanent, potentially unnecessary surgery.
                        </p>

                        <h5>The Choice</h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            The trouble is that going into surgery means removing the thyroid, which means you will need
                            to undergo hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. If you remove the thyroid
                            suspecting cancer, but after the fact discover that no cancer was present, you've removed an
                            important organ from your body permanently and it was unnecessary. The feeling of
                            discovering you just underwent an unnecessary life altering surgery is difficult to describe
                            for patients, but I have heard it described as a mixture of happiness and regret. You're
                            pleased because now you know for certain that you don't have cancer, but you lament the fact
                            that you did not need to remove the thyroid and now need hormone replacement therapy. </p>
                        <p class="justified-text">
                            This choice has implications beyond the simple cancer diagnosis. If you keep getting
                            indeterminant biopsies like I did my first three visits you are forced to live with the idea
                            that you must choose the right option. You need to walk around every day with the knowledge
                            that you may have cancer and are choosing not to have it removed. It is impossible to say if
                            this alternate possibility is better than hormone replacement, but the psychological impact
                            of this decision is quite significant. My case was not severe by most metrics, but still my
                            mental health suffered with the weight of this decision on my mind. I was unable to focus in
                            class, and was constantly researching thyroid cancer, trying to figure out my rate of
                            survival given each course of action.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Consulting a Specialist</h5>


                        <p class="justified-text">I cannot emphasize enough that consulting with a thyroid surgeon was
                            an absolute must. He gave me the information and confidence to form a decision. I was given
                            a through explanation of the condition and all the deciding factors, a conversation that
                            lasted over an hour. I was given the choice to get another biopsy or to monitor with
                            ultrasound. I even suggested draining the nodule to reduce cystic content for better biopsy
                            sampling.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Alternatives to Surgery</h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I knew that statistically speaking the it is very unlikely that next biopsy will provide
                            useful results after several non-diagnostic tests. I asked about alternative biopsies such
                            as surgical or core-needle biopsies. These both have their own set of severe drawbacks. A
                            surgical biopsy is considered so dangerous it is no longer permitted in the medical field,
                            due to the likelihood that the lyrangeal nerve will be damaged or severed. A core needle
                            biopsy uses a larger needle, introducing more risks, longer recovery, and a risk to damage
                            the carotid artery. </p>
                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I eventually proposed the idea of draining fluid during a traditional fine needle aspiration
                            biopsy. This would make the nodule behave less cystic (fluid filled) and possibly make the
                            tissue easier to collect inside the needle. I was nervous to ask the interventional
                            radiologist to try something different that I hadn't even heard of online, but I was
                            determined to find a different strategy to improve my chances. I am pleased to report that
                            my latest biopsy came back with more conclusive results. It was characterized and is
                            associated with a far lower risk of cancer than the odds I was given back in September of
                            2024. I reflect on reading these results and consider how close I was to choosing surgery.
                            In November of 2024 I was certain that my appointment with the surgeon would result in
                            booking a surgery. By January of 2025 I had a more concrete understanding of the condition
                            and made the right decision regarding surgery vs active monitoring.
                        </p>


                        <p class="justified-text">Ultimately, this project taught me how to bring clarity to a deeply
                            ambiguous real-world challenge. It wasn't just an exercise in numbers or decision theory—it
                            gave me language and structure to think through the most important decision of my life to
                            date. I now understand what it means to weigh tradeoffs under uncertainty, how to identify
                            meaningful objectives, and how to respect the influence of both quantitative and qualitative
                            outcomes. This course helped me become not just a better decision-maker, but a more
                            analytical and self-aware individual during a difficult time.

                        involved in modern chip design. Through hands-on use of Cadence, I gained practical experience
                        in simulation and verification of digital integrated circuit design. This class deepened my
                        technical skills in digital design but also sharpened my problem-solving abilities in adapting
                        to a new simulation software.

                            I chose to take Digital Integrated Circuits because it represented the culmination of all my
                            prior graduate coursework—bringing clarity to what I once considered the “mystery” within
                            electronics. Digital circuits have always fascinated me, and after taking Analog Circuits
                            with Professor Sahoo the previous semester, I was eager to continue learning under his

                            As electrical engineers, it’s common knowledge how transistors work, how their
                            characteristics affect circuits and how important their properties are when designing
                            digital circuits. However, the more nuanced knowledge is in the specifics. How are
                            transistors manufactured that creates such properties? Why do we as engineers need to design
                            for components with variance in characteristics. In undergraduate work, we are taught that
                            transistors may have vastly different

                            new and interesting effects are observed when looking at such a small scale, and how we are
                            able to procure designs that are not only functional, but feasible to produce with

                            As designs scale down and shift toward MOSFET-based logic, additional factors come into
                            play. MOSFET layouts must account not only for electrical properties, but also for physical
                            constraints such as chip area, signal delay, and fabrication cost. In high-density designs,
                            parasitic capacitance between terminals can impact switching performance, and routing

                            touch. For instance, in FPGA design, although computation architectures can be generalized,
                            specific hardware blocks—often referred to as "Math Blocks"—are carefully crafted to perform
                            specific functions with maximum speed and area efficiency.

                            Most of the challenges I encountered in this class were related to using Cadence. This
                            program, which we used to simulate and analyze circuits, could only be run on UB's network,
                            so we had to remote into lab machines to access it. I found that my greatest improvement
                            came from becoming effective at using this complex tool within the constraints of a remote
                            setup. I also learned a lot about Linux systems, which I had limited experience with prior.
                            These skills will serve me well if I need to work with Cadence or Linux in industry.

                            how to make it more efficient. What surprised me was how much of the optimization process
                            came down to trial and error, fine-tuning configurations, and simulating countless
                            variations. I expected to be tackling large-scale components like a 3-bit multiplier, but I
                            quickly realized that even a 4-bit ripple carry adder could occupy an entire class period’s

                            The most powerful concept introduced in this course was Logical Effort. Before this class, I
                            had a vague understanding of delay and optimization, but here I learned how to quantify
                            delay rigorously using the equation: <code>d = gh + p</code>, where <code>g</code> is
                            logical effort, <code>h</code> is electrical effort (fanout), and <code>p</code> is
                            parasitic delay. We applied this to multi-stage designs, datapath planning, and gate sizing,
                            giving me a framework to design high-performance circuits.

                            adder tree, memory blocks, control logic, and a synchronous counter—all functioning as a
                            simplified neural network accelerator. We processed 16 inputs and 16 coefficients in
                            parallel. The project taught me about pipeline register placement, clock domain
                            synchronization, and debugging timing issues across an integrated datapath.

                            The lectures on gate sizing and stage delay revealed subtle design tradeoffs. For example,
                            minimizing the number of stages doesn’t always yield the fastest circuit. Sometimes,
                            breaking a path into more stages with optimally sized gates gives better results. We used
                            spreadsheets to calculate optimal stage effort, fanout, and gate capacitance. Case studies
                            included FO4 inverter chains, 16-bit decoders, and register file designs, where NAND gates
                            consistently proved more area- and delay-efficient than NOR equivalents.

                        My co-op experience at Tapecon allowed me to work on cutting-edge Flexible Hybrid Electronics
                        (FHE),
                        a rapidly evolving field in electrical engineering. Throughout my internship, I designed and
                        prototyped FHE circuits,
                        optimized manufacturing processes, and contributed to Tapecon’s goal of becoming the leading
                        manufacturer of FHE.
                        My work involved microcontroller programming, circuit design, and troubleshooting advanced
                        machinery used in production.
                        Several of my projects were presented at NextFlex Conferences in California and Berlin in 2023.
                        This reflection details
                        my contributions, the challenges I faced, and the skills I developed.

                        <h5>Introduction to Tapecon and its FHE Evolution</h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            Tapecon is a company that has produced tape, stickers, adhesives, prints, and various other
                            products throughout
                            most of its history. Recently, Tapecon has begun leveraging its expertise in adhesives and
                            printing to produce
                            Flexible Hybrid Electronics (FHE)—a new category of electronics that integrates printed
                            circuits on flexible dielectric sheets
                            rather than using traditional rigid circuit boards. This approach allows for thin, compact,
                            and flexible electronics that have applications
                            in wearable technology, medical devices, and industrial automation.
                        </p>



                        <h5>Challenges and Problem-Solving</h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            One of the main challenges in FHE development is achieving sustainability while maintaining
                            efficiency. Traditional PCBs
                            use large amounts of metal and non-recyclable materials, whereas FHE circuits can be printed
                            with small amounts of
                            conductive inks on flexible substrates, reducing waste.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            One of my first projects involved designing an FHE flood detector circuit using only a BJT
                            transistor and conductive
                            traces. The industry standard for flood detection circuits requires a 3-inch circuit board,
                            but I was able to reduce the
                            footprint to less than a half-inch while maintaining full functionality.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Technical Achievements and Contributions</h5>

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            My work at Tapecon extended beyond just designing FHE circuits. I also developed programming
                            and debugging
                            devices used for testing FHE circuits before deployment. One of my key contributions was the
                            FHE temperature
                            detector circuit, which was showcased at the NextFlex Conference in California and Berlin in
                            2023.

                        </ul>


                        <p class="justified-text">
                            My co-op experience at Tapecon has been incredibly rewarding. Over the past two semesters
                            and two summers, I have
                            had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology, refine my engineering skills, and
                            contribute to projects that
                            were presented at international conferences.

                        <p class="justified-text">
                            I have worked with large industrial equipment, including the Universal Pick and Place
                            machine, which is capable of
                            placing over 200,000 components per hour. My exposure to these machines helped me refine
                            circuit designs to
                            accommodate efficient component placement.

                            these responsibilities
                            required strong organizational skills and time management.
                        </p>

                        <p class="justified-text">
