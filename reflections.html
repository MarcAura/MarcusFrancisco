                <h1>EE 541 Reflection: Exploring Deep Learning</h1>

                <p class="justified-text">
                    I took EE 541 to dive into a completely new field within Electrical Engineering that piqued my
                    interest. I excel in mathematics and physics and have always been fascinated by the "black-box
                    magic" of deep learning. To me, calculus is clear-cut, motivated by the pursuit of truth through
                    numbers, while physics employs theoretical principles and laws to bring order to an otherwise
                    unpredictable world. However, at the time of taking this class, deep learning seemed entirely
                    different. Electrical Engineering is rooted in mathematics, differential equations, and physics, all
                    governed by well-defined laws. At first glance, artificial intelligence and machine learning
                    appeared far less structured, relying on unknown weights in a neural network.

                    Neural networks operate in a way that more closely resembles the human brain than traditional
                    circuits. One of the most common applications of neural networks is handwriting recognition. Below
                    is an example from my EE 541 project, where I trained a neural network using a dataset of
                    handwritten numbers.

                    I took signal analysis with Professor Ali in the prior semester. After this class, I knew I wanted
                    to take another course with him. I thoroughly enjoyed his teaching style, from his in-depth
                    explanations to his ability to keep students engaged—even offering protein shakes as incentives. He
                    prefers using chalk, which gives him an old-school approach that I appreciate, particularly since
                    the content of this course was anything but old-school. This course was based on recent engineering
                    research, with some journal articles published the same year we studied them. This made me excited
                    to learn about an unfamiliar yet relevant topic from a professor whose teaching style resonated with
                    me.

                <p class="justified-text">
                    Deep learning can seem abstract, and understanding every facet of a neural network may not be
                    feasible. However, one can form an understanding of the principles and methods used to achieve its
                    design. Neural networks have hundreds or even thousands of nodes and weights, adjusted through
                    learning algorithms that we can build and understand. However, determining why each weight changes
                    and its precise effect on the output is complex. A mathematician [Author Name of 3B1B] explains this
                    well in his breakdown of neural network behavior over successive training cycles.

                    For an excellent visualization of neural networks and their growth through training, I highly
                    recommend this video: [LINK TO 3B1B]. 3B1B is an incredible YouTube channel that has inspired me to
                    explore more advanced areas of mathematics and challenge myself in fields such as deep learning.

                    Throughout the course, I struggled with the abstract nature of this field. To tackle this, I had to
                    accept that fully comprehending every aspect of a deep learning module may not be realistic. Despite
                    this, I was able to learn and design effective models. Over time, I gained a deeper understanding of
                    Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. Randomness plays a critical role in deep learning, often
                    complicating things. However, this randomness is beneficial—it drives educational exploration. A
                    deep learning model must sometimes explore uncharted paths, even if the algorithm is uncertain
                    whether the outcome will improve. This allows the model to discover new, potentially superior
                    approaches.

                    This mirrors my experience in taking EE 541. Much like a neural network making weight adjustments
                    based on limited knowledge, I ventured into an unfamiliar field unsure of my success. Yet, by
                    exploring deep learning, I have grown as an engineer. Much like a neural network performing training
                    to explore alternative options, I took a leap by enrolling in EE 541 without knowing whether I would
                    excel. In the end, I believe I am better for it.


                    Initially, I believed that deep learning was completely different from the predictable, theory-based
                    mathematics I was comfortable with. However, having completed the course, I now understand that this
                    is not the case. A neural network and its teaching algorithm are ultimately just a complex system of
                    equations, designed to adjust weights in a way that optimizes outcomes. In many ways, deep learning
                    is an extension of traditional mathematical principles—it’s simply applied in a novel, dynamic way.

                <h1>EE 553 Reflection: Microfabrication Lab Experience</h1>

                <p class="justified-text">
                    I entered the class for Microfabrication of Circuits excited to witness the fundamental processes
                    underlying Electrical Engineering. Much of my EE background and undergraduate education is based on
                    transistors, microelectronics, and the core principles of electrical circuit behavior, including
                    properties of current and voltage. From a broad perspective, basic circuits with a DC source,
                    resistors, and reactive components are easy to comprehend. However, delving deeper into Electrical
                    Engineering reveals complexities such as internal resistance and forward biasing. While these
                    phenomena can be analyzed through differential equations and theoretical models, they are difficult
                    to visualize, making direct observation nearly impossible.

                    To witness microfabrication firsthand is to look behind the curtain, replacing conceptual
                    imagination with real-world experiences in the lab. Since learning how a computer worked in
                    elementary school, I had been eager to understand how computer chips, transistors, and memory
                    devices are made. This course provided a pivotal moment where all my undergraduate Electrical
                    Engineering studies converged into an opportunity to observe microfabrication machines in action.


                    In the microfabrication lab, we worked with highly specialized and expensive equipment. We began by
                    learning how to use an ellipsometer, a device that . From there, we explored Electron Beam
                    Lithography (EBL) and had the opportunity to examine an Electron Beam Microscope. These machines
                    range in costand require extensive care, training, and supervision to operate. In the EBL process,
                    we adhered specific metals to silicon by first applying a thin 2um layer of platinum on the
                    spin-coated silicon surface. This platinum layer served as an intermediary to enhance the adhesion
                    of gold, as gold adheres poorly to silicon but bonds well to platinum.
                    One of the most fascinating properties we observed was the way incident light reflects off gold
                    nanoparticles. In EBL, an electron beam is directed at a filament of gold, platinum, or another
                    metal. The beam vaporizes the metal, and the vaporized material is then deposited onto a surface in
                    precise patterns. Using this method, we achieved deposition resolutions as fine as 2um.

                    Gold nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent optical properties, allowing them to reflect different
                    frequencies of light. This phenomenon was historically used in ancient times in stained glass
                    windows, where molten glass mixed with gold nanoparticles produced vibrant red hues. In our lab, we
                    unintentionally observed this effect due to a unique occurrence in the deposition process. The EBL
                    machine uses clips to hold down the sample, which inadvertently blocked some of the vaporized gold
                    deposition. This obstruction created a gradient of gold thickness across the sample.

                    An interesting observation was that this deposition gradient resulted in thicknesses below the
                    minimum deposition capability of the EBL machine. This created a visible color gradient on the
                    sample, which we attributed to the optical properties of gold nanoparticles. Our final report
                    documented all experiments performed throughout the semester, including:
                    , Ellipsometry to measure oxide layer thickness on silicon, Electron Beam Lithography (EBL), E-Beam
                    microscope usage, Microfabrication-grade microscope analysis, Profilometry with a newly acquired
                    profilometer , Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) etching experiments, measuring etch rate over time

                    Additionally, my lab partners and I went beyond the standard course requirements to analyze and
                    document the unexpected gold deposition gradient.

                    Spin coating was another technique we utilized in our experiments. The HF etching study examined the
                    rate at which silicon was etched per second in the HF solution, providing valuable data on
                    controlled material removal. Getting suited up for the cleanroom was a unique experience. The "bunny
                    suit" worn inside the cleanroom is not for personal safety but rather to protect the sensitive
                    materials and equipment from contamination. Given the extreme sensitivity of these machines, all
                    potential contaminants, including dust and skin particles, must be contained within the suit. Each
                    suit comes in a sterilized plastic package, and we were trained to put them on in a way that
                    prevents external contamination. Before entering the cleanroom, we passed through an air shower,
                    which blasted pressurized air to remove any residual dust or contaminants.

                    My experience in the cleanroom was one of the most valuable aspects of my time at UB. This course
                    provided hands-on exposure to the processes required to fabricate the devices and materials that
                    power modern technology. It reinforced my understanding of Electrical Engineering by grounding
                    theoretical concepts in tangible experiences. Rather than relying solely on diagrams and equations,
                    I now have firsthand knowledge of the fabrication techniques that make microelectronics possible.

                <h1>Reflection 3: EE 526 - Wearable and Implantable Sensors, Professor Kwang Oh</h1>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    When deciding to take Wearable and Implantable Sensors, I considered the multiple projects I’ve
                    contributed to in the past. Multiple hackathon projects, independent works, and an award-winning
                    research project.

                    I have worked on various projects in IoT, embedded systems, wireless communication, and power
                    electronics. I worked on 5G KPI analysis which examined the impact of weather on 5G performance
                    using a Raspberry Pi with a 5G hat, and a UPS system providing a cost-effective backup power
                    solution with deep-cycle batteries as part of my coursework. I also co-authored a published research
                    project on Interactive Digital Twins, presented at ACM SenSys ‘22. I became team lead of this
                    research project in 2023, worked on device firmware and intercommunication, and we were awarded the
                    Russel Agrusa Student Innovation Award. Additionally, I contributed to multiple award-winning
                    hackathon projects, such as a fire prevention system, modular security system, and a plastic bottle
                    recycling machine for 3D printer filament. My work has refined my system design ability, knowledge
                    on automation, and real-time data processing.

                    All of these projects involved some degree of sensor usage. Combine this affinity for projects using
                    sensors with my love for Dr. Oh’s teaching style, and I knew at once I was dead-set on taking this
                    class.
                    I learned in this class many specialized topics such as microfluidics, accelerometers, inertial
                    sensors, and recent developments in sensor technology.
                    EE526 provided background in the design, implementation, and optimization of wearable and
                    implantable sensor systems. The course covered covering microfluidics, wireless communication, power
                    management, biocompatibility, and data processing for biomedical and IoT applications.

                    What I believe was most important is refining my ability to put thought and effort into planning a
                    project on a strict timeline. The projects Dr. Oh assigned were broad enough in subject matter that
                    you could select something you were genuinely interested in. For my project, I chose to make a WiFi
                    and Bluetooth IoT network with an Android app from scratch. In completing this project, I achieved
                    two main milestones that were not exactly course requirements, but were necessary for the completion
                    of my project. For my combination WiFi and BLE project, I developed my own device connection and
                    intercommunication protocol, and I developed an android app having no prior knowledge on how to do
                    so. These skills are not directly related to wearable and implantable sensors, however they both
                    were required to complete the project. For this, I needed to take initiative and learn the skills
                    needed to complete each milestone.

                    To be clear, the class doesn’t cover app development, device wireless intercommunication, firmware
                    development, or some of the other tools needed to create my project I dubbed "BlueLink", but
                    Professor Oh urged that students figure out how to acquire the necessary skills to complete project
                    on their own time. I believe this was a great environment, because it forced you to be more
                    realistic about your project expectations, while also getting you invested in project completion.
                    This setup was very helpful to me since it motivated me to start early since there were many
                    uncertain factors in my project. What I recommend for others taking this course is to aim big on the
                    final project and begin scoping out the skills and technologies needed to complete it very early.
                    Dr. Oh gives you the project prompt on the first day of class with the syllabus so you can start as
                    early as the first day.
                    For me, this meant exploring how to build an Android app, and also re-kindling the embers of device
                    intercommunication I acquired working on my research project in past years.
                    Beforehand, working for the ISE department, I was able to establish wired serial communication
                    between two devices with different microcontrollers and hardware. This project presented a different
                    challenge. I now need to establish bi-directional intercommunication between two of the same type of
                    device, (ESP32s), but now the devices operate with different connection protocols. My work
                    beforehand was two different types of hardware communicating, but in this project two different
                    types of firmware must communication. One ESP must communicate via WiFi with the internet and the
                    other must communicate via Bluetooth with the WiFi device.

                    The biggest challenge I encountered was programming one of these small, inexpensive devices to use
                    both BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and WiFi at the same time. This large challenge concerned the amount
                    of Flash Memory the devices have available. Flash memory on an ESP32 is used to store the program
                    code, libraries, and necessary data for execution, allowing the microcontroller to retain firmware
                    even after a power cycle. When a program exceeds the available flash memory, the device may fail to
                    compile, crash, or enter a reboot loop due to insufficient storage. To accommodate for this, you can
                    optimize memory usage by reducing the program size (removing unused libraries, optimizing code, or
                    using PROGMEM for constants), increasing partition sizes in the ESP32’s partition table, or using
                    external flash storage for non-critical data.

                    The device didn’t have enough flash memory to hold the program and execute it properly. The infinite
                    reboot loop is what my ESP32 devices did whenever I attempted to use both communication types as the
                    same time. This gave me a small hint that the ESP had enough memory to store the program but not
                    enough to run it. To fix this, I altered the partition scheme and eventually found a configuration
                    that would support my connection protocol.
                    Other challenges were power usage and optimizing data processing to draw less power and use less
                    memory. The two competing connection protocols caused the chip to draw too much power, causing a
                    "brownout" or low voltage shutdown, and the two types of communication deliver messages in different
                    formats. Command conversion was needed on the chip, and optimizing this was crucial since I had a
                    limited amount of power and space. At one point I realized I was running too many ESP32 devices on
                    one power supply, resulting in a brownout error. This was a separate problem from the brownout
                    shutdown I mentioned earlier. This problem was amongst the easiest to solve since it only required I
                    get another USB power supply, however that didn't prevent the hours of troubleshooting through
                    software before I discovered the real cause of the problem.
                    My approach to problem solving here needed to be consistent and robust if I were to finish this
                    project on time. By this I mean I needed to implement changes iteratively, so most of the time I am
                    able to deduce the source of an error quickly and begin troubleshooting immediately. If I
                    implemented a hundred changes at once, finding issues would be more similar to finding a needle in a
                    haystack. I tackled each problem one at a time, testing multiple devices each time to make sure the
                    problems were not just a faulty chip. Problems arising from manufacturing defects in the chips
                    happened twice in this project. I reallocated flash memory to program storage by changing the
                    partition scheme, implemented power-saving connection methods, and wrote my own command system
                    specifically for this setup.
                    What I am left with is an IoT network with multiple devices. It uses my own connection protocol that
                    I wrote, and since it uses both BLE and WiFi, local operations do not depend on WiFi, so if a user's
                    WiFi goes down, device intercommunication persists. An example of where this would be useful is if
                    you set up routines for a light or device to turn on and off at a certain time, WiFi dependence may
                    become a cumbersome for IoT networks in this application where WiFi is not really even necessary in
                    the first place. This network makes it so WiFi is only used for commands and instructions that need
                    WiFi to communicate with an outside device, leaving the rest up to the Low Power Bluetooth network
                    made up of inexpensive ESP32 devices.

                    Taking on a demanding project like this was a risk. I was unsure at the start if I would be able to
                    do much if not any of the action items I described above. My work paid off in many ways: I now am
                    more experienced with conceptualizing, planning, and executing a project on a realistic timeline,
                    and I have a project I can carry on developing outside of class.
                    For me, these are very important to my career. I want to build technologies and systems that people
                    can use alongside my engineering career. I believe being able to bring a project from start to
                    finish by yourself requires discipline that is only obtained by doing it, going through the process.
                    This discipline is what this class taught me.

                    The prompt was essentially to create an IoT device using a microcontroller platform such as Arduino.
                    My project was much more complicated than that, creating five separate fully functional IoT devices
                    using the ESP32 microcontroller development board, and then creating an IoT network, Android App,
                    and Web Server using my own connection protocol to connect them all. I could have developed
                    something simpler, but I knew my potential, and worked to maximize what I was capable of creating
                    under these conditions.

                    I feel most accomplished with the fact that I stuck with my original goals (with some slight
                    alterations) instead of simplifying my project just to get an easy A. My goal was to create
                    something worthwhile that would grant me more than a good grade, and I believe under the conditions

                <h1>Reflection 4: EE 550 - Photovoltaic Technology, Professor Ian R. Sellers</h1>
                <p class="justified-text">
                    
                    I enrolled in EE 550 expecting to deepen my understanding of photovoltaic (PV) technology beyond the surface-level knowledge I had gained from prior coursework and projects. I had previously worked with solar panels in my senior design project, where I became familiar with key characteristics such as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and the equivalent circuit representation of solar cells as a current source with diode behavior. However, this class introduced me to a far more nuanced perspective—one that made me re-think how I critically assess emerging technologies and the claims made in research and the industry.

                    One of the most significant takeaways from this course was learning to approach new photovoltaic technologies with a more critical mindset. In 2021, I wrote a paper on perovskite solar cells, a technology widely hailed for its potential to revolutionize the solar industry due to its high efficiency, tunable bandgap, and low-cost fabrication. At the time, my research was based on recent publications that portrayed perovskites as the next major leap in solar power. While I acknowledged concerns regarding their stability and service life, I largely focused on their advantages and future prospects. However, in EE 550, I gained a more balanced and skeptical perspective on the practical feasibility of perovskite-based photovoltaics.
                    
                    Through discussions with Professor Sellers during class, I learned that much of the excitement surrounding perovskites is fueled by highly selective data, with many research papers presenting only the most optimistic results while glossing over fundamental reliability issues. For example, while perovskite solar cells can demonstrate efficiencies exceeding 25\% in controlled lab environments, their long-term stability is a major concern. Many perovskite cells degrade within weeks, far from the decades-long service life expected from commercial solar panels. Additionally, yield reporting in perovskite manufacturing is often absent, meaning that while individual cells may be inexpensive to produce, the true cost skyrockets if hundreds must be fabricated to obtain a single functional unit.
                    
                    This realization reshaped my view of technological hype in renewable energy. While innovations are necessary to advance solar power, the premature excitement surrounding some emerging technologies can lead to unrealistic expectations and, ultimately, public distrust when those technologies fail to deliver on exaggerated promises. It is crucial to distinguish between lab-scale success and real-world viability, considering not only efficiency but also manufacturing scalability, stability, and deployment challenges.
                    
                    I wrote a paper on Perovskite usage in solar panels in 2021. My report adresses some of the issues mentioned here, but it glances over the more concerning fact that perovskites are not proven to have a suitable service life for Photovoltaic panels. My report written on perovskites can be accessed via this link: 
                    <a href="https://marcaura.github.io/MarcusFrancisco/pdfs/perovskites.pdf" target="_blank">Perovskite Solar Cells Report</a>
                    
                    What I found in this class was a more realistic view on how useful perovskites are for widespread use. Professor Sellers was able to look past the hype, and was not easily convinced of perovskite panel feasibility like I was in years prior.
                    
                    Beyond perovskites, this course also provided valuable insight into the engineering and design principles behind PV systems. One particularly interesting topic was the role of boost converters in photovoltaic applications. As I am simultaneously studying power electronics in another course, I found it fascinating to see the direct application of DC-DC converters in maximizing the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Boost converters are commonly used in PV systems to step up the voltage from solar panels while maintaining maximum power transfer through MPPT algorithms. This connection between power electronics and photovoltaics reinforced how interdisciplinary renewable energy systems truly are.
                    
                    Another key takeaway was the complexity of integrating solar power into the electrical grid. Many people assume that the main challenge with solar power is simply storing excess energy to compensate for intermittency. While energy storage is important, EE 550 introduced me to the numerous technical and economic challenges beyond just storage. These include grid stability, voltage regulation, power electronics for grid interconnection, and the impact of variable solar generation on traditional power infrastructure.
                    
                    Overall, EE 550 has significantly refined my critical thinking when evaluating solar technologies. It has taught me to question the sustainability and practicality of emerging PV solutions rather than accepting optimistic projections at face value. While I still believe that perovskites and other next-generation materials may play a role in the future of solar energy, I now understand the importance of long-term reliability, economic feasibility, and scalable manufacturing as key factors in determining whether a new technology will succeed beyond the laboratory.
                    
                    This course has not only strengthened my technical understanding of photovoltaics but also provided me with a more grounded perspective—one that will be invaluable in my career as an engineer working in renewable energy. Moving forward, I will continue to approach emerging technologies with a balance of curiosity and skepticism, ensuring that my assessments are based on both scientific rigor and real-world viability.
